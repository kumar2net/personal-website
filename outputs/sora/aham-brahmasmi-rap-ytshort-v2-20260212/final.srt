1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Aham Brahmasmi. Knowledge is the real flex.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Screens are loud, but truth is deeper than trends.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ask better questions. Drop fake noise.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
अहं ब्रह्मास्मि - inner light, not ego hype.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
ज्ञान की राह, सवालों से खुलती है.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ ಕೇಳು, ಅರಿವಿನ ದಾರಿ ಹಿಡು.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Busca verdad. Om in the background, clarity in the mind.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Questions become knowledge. Knowledge becomes light.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Part 2? Comment "Om" for the next verse.
