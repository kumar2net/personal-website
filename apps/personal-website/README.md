# Personal Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bfc9b371-d915-45d3-a051-c92d45dd1206/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/kumarweb/deploys)

Personal site for Kumar A. built with React and Vite. The project bundles together long‑form writing, project dossiers, utilities dashboards, book notes, and AI‑assisted experiments that run off Netlify Functions and a lightweight Python backend.

See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for a detailed history.

## Feature Snapshot

- **Blog & Knowledge Library** – Rich MD/JSX posts with badges, tables, embeds, and a semantic-search powered landing page.
- **Projects Hub** – Narrative write-ups paired with motion-enhanced visuals, plus deep dives like the AI recommender code viewer.
- **AI & Analytics Utilities** – Serverless functions for topic recommendations, semantic search backed by OpenAI embeddings, tech-trend aggregation, and CMS helpers.
- **Dashboards** – Utilities spending dashboard, status page, dossier timelines, and other data-first explorations.
- **Books & Notes** – Mixed media content (Markdown, PDF excerpts, DOCX conversions) routed through lazily loaded page bundles.
- **Backend Support** – Optional Node/Python services that feed GA4 + BigQuery powered recommendations.
- **Observability** – Vercel Speed Insights instrumentation baked into the root React tree for real-user performance analytics without extra setup.

```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (ships with Node 18)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumar2net/personal-website.git
cd personal-website
npm install
```

### Semantic Search Index

The semantic search API reads vectors from `src/data/semantic-index.json`. Regenerate it whenever blog content changes:

```bash
npm run --workspace apps/personal-website semantic:index
```

The script loads every `src/pages/blog/*.jsx` file, strips JSX to text, calls OpenAI embedding models (default `text-embedding-3-small`), and snapshots vectors plus metadata into the JSON index. Production builds run the same command via `npm run build`, so keeping `OPENAI_API_KEY` set ensures Vercel/Netlify builds stay up to date.

### Start a Dev Server

```bash
# Default Vite dev server (fast iteration)
npm run dev

# Netlify-style environment with serverless functions
npm run dev:netlify
```

`npm run dev` uses the custom Vite middleware to proxy `/api/convert` and `/api/semantic-search` into the Node handlers so the semantic index is queried without deploying functions.

### Quality & Tooling

```bash
# Lint entire project
npm run lint

# Biome static analysis
npm run biome:check

# Test scripts (unit + e2e wrappers)
npm run test:all
```

### Build Output

```bash
npm run build
# Outputs to dist/
```

## Catch-up posts

The global "Catch up" pill highlights blog posts published since you last marked yourself as caught up.

- Storage: the most recent catch-up time is stored in `localStorage` under `user_last_catchup_v1`.
- Header UI: the navigation pill shows a badge with the number of new posts and opens a modal list capped at 12 items.
- Blog page: a banner surfaces the same count, lets you filter to recent posts, and exposes a "Mark as caught up" action.
- QA tip: inspect `user_last_catchup_v1` in your browser's localStorage to review or reset the stored timestamp.

## Deployment Notes

- Production hosting runs on Netlify with automated deploys from `master`.
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist/`
- Review `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` for pre-flight checks, quality gates, and manual deploy instructions.
