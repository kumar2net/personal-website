          Democratic apathy means widespread disinterest in politics and the democratic process. It shows up as low voter turnout, avoiding political discussions, and a sense that participation doesn’t matter. This isn’t always anger—often it’s indifference or disillusionment. I liked the way Kingsley put it across, and it resonated with me.

          Several factors feed democratic apathy. Many feel their single vote won’t change anything, especially in winner-take-all systems. Scandals and broken promises deepen distrust. People, especially youth, feel disconnected when the system doesn’t meet their needs. Barriers like complicated registration and limited polling access discourage participation. Media sensationalism and cultural shifts further fragment engagement. Lower-income groups, minorities, and young people often feel this apathy most acutely.
          My take: in India, parties sometimes pay money and ask voters to take vows in front of the குல தெய்வம். When politics is treated as a transaction, people stop seeing the vote as a civic duty and start seeing it as another exchange. Many poor people are so god-fearing they won’t cross that line.

          When many don’t vote, election results skew toward active, often older or wealthier voters. This weakens accountability, allowing poor governance and corruption to grow. Governments lose legitimacy when large portions abstain. This vacuum lets extremists and fringe groups gain influence. Beyond politics, apathy harms civic health and fuels inequality, especially across generations. It’s not laziness but often a rational response to broken systems, creating a cycle that threatens democracy itself.
