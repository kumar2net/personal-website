          Crisis seldom arrives with a warning. Stress, relocation fatigue, and burnout build silently until your body protests. The fix is simple: sleep on time, eat regularly, and move for 20 minutes daily. These are basics, not motivational slogans. Women's health coverage deserves praise for treating life stages as biology, not attitude. Menstrual pain in teens should not be dismissed. Better nutrition and symptom tracking are essential during reproductive years. Perimenopause and menopause call for renewed focus on protein, iron, magnesium, and recovery. Early action prevents compounded problems. The issue's middle path blends tradition and evidence: yoga, breathing, and community support regulate daily life, while wearables, screening, and treatment address persistent symptoms. Rest is maintenance, not laziness.

          Gen Alpha Slang Decoder (Before We Get Called Aliens)

          Gen Alpha's language sounds alien to adults. Here's a quick decoder: 'Rizz' means charisma or social confidence; 'Gyatt' reacts to someone's looks; 'Skibidi' is a chaotic filler word; 'Sigma' describes an independent lone wolf; 'Mewing' refers to a jawline posture trend; 'Fanum Tax' means stealing a friend's food; 'Ohio' signals a weird or cursed situation; 'Brainrot' describes meme overload; 'W' and 'L' mean win and loss; 'Lowkey' and 'Highkey' express degrees of feeling; 'Delulu' means playfully delusional. Language shifts fast - master these today, and they may be outdated tomorrow.

          Tamil Nadu Election Season: Comedy Every Day, Questions Still Pending

          Tamil Nadu's election season delivers daily political theatre but little policy clarity. The Parliament follows a similar pattern: high drama, low resolution. Memes entertain, yet voters deserve straightforward answers on jobs, water, infrastructure, inflation, and health. Punchlines don't run states.

          Why Coimbatore Reveres G.D. Naidu

          G.D. Naidu, called the 'Edison of India,' shaped Coimbatore's industrial identity. His early electric motors and machine tools accelerated manufacturing growth. His innovations in transport boosted public transit reliability. The electric razor he designed showed India could create practical consumer tech. His prototypes, including calculators and voting machines, reflected relentless engineering curiosity. His hands-on work built a culture of frugal, local problem-solving. His legacy feels personal because he proved world-class engineering thrives outside global capitals. He linked invention to enterprise, creating jobs and momentum. He inspired a practical mindset: test fast, improve constantly, solve real problems. His institutions keep technical curiosity alive across generations. February teaches us an old truth: progress honors both caregivers and inventors.
