          Anticipating Major Announcements from Frontier Labs
        </h2>

            As we approach the Thanksgiving weekend, I sense we are on the brink of some significant announcements from all the Frontier Labs. These labs are pushing the boundaries, much like the mythical Kadothgajan yearning for compute capacity. Looking ahead, I believe 2026 will serve as a critical litmus test for their progress. Today, if I were to list my top five Frontier Labs, I would focus on those making the most impactful strides in advancing technology and compute resources.

          Our Role in Reducing Carbon Footprint
        </h2>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Beyond technological advances, it's crucial to remember our responsibility towards the environment. Regardless of agreements or policies, each of us must contribute to reducing our carbon footprint. Dr. Abdul Kalam once wisely said, "Don't ask what your country has done for you; ask what you can contribute to your country." This resonates deeply as a call to personal action in the face of global challenges.

          The Future with AGI and Automation
        </h2>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            What happens when AGI is achieved and automation takes over the myriad tasks we perform daily? Robots will handle many of our sundry jobs, and we might find ourselves endlessly scrolling on screens, passing time. This scenario urges us to rethink how we engage with technology and seek meaningful ways to use our time.

          Evolving Human Skills in a Tech-Driven Era
        </h2>

            Traditional skills like typing at high speeds, shorthand writing, stenography, mastering multiple languages, grammar, vocabulary, and converting between measurement units are becoming obsolete. We no longer need to memorize these, thanks to technology. What remains is the need for a more natural, intuitive interface—moving beyond mobile devices and touchscreens to reliable voice and vision-based interactions. A recent example is the Lenskart IPO in India, which garnered attention for spectacles that enable payments through UPI by simply looking at a QR code presented by shopkeepers. This innovation hints at the seamless integration of technology into daily life.
