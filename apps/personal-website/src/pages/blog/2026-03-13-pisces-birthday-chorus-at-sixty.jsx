            On March 13, 2026, I turned 60. The video that reached me today did
            not feel like a formal tribute. It felt like water: voices arriving
            in waves, each one carrying memory, teasing, gratitude, advice, and
            affection back to me.

            One voice located me across three technological eras: the internet,
            the computer revolution, and now AI. Another thanked me not for
            achievement but for steadiness after loss. The younger generation
            said something even harder to earn: that they had learned
            discipline, kindness, responsibility, and humility by watching.
            Others simply said what family says when it means it most: we love
            you, eat well, stay healthy, keep in touch, come see us soon.

            A March 13 footnote
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ ...bodyTextSx, mb: 0 }}>
            March 13 comes with a few curious cultural and historical
            coincidences. This year, March 13, 2026, also happens to fall on
            the famous <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, a date many people
            consider unlucky, even though <strong>13 is actually a prime
            number</strong>, mathematically elegant rather than ominous.
            Because of long-standing superstition, many <strong>hotels and
            office buildings skip the 13th floor</strong>, airlines sometimes
            avoid row 13, and some people postpone travel or big decisions on
            that day. Yet historically the month itself symbolizes beginnings:
            in the calendar of <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>, <strong>March was
            originally the first month of the year</strong>, representing
            renewal and fresh starts. The date also appears in the story of
            human exploration, as <strong>Apollo 9</strong> launched on March
            13 to test the lunar module systems that later enabled astronauts
