          Terms of Service agreements are mostly a joke. Who actually reads those multi-page, tiny-font conditions? These documents are designed to protect companies, not users. Governments often ignore them altogether, pulling data or setting rules beyond whatever we clicked “accept” on. Technology, regardless of its promise, will be used by both good and bad actors. The real danger is how quickly these tools can lead us to self-destruction.

          Michael Spencer recently made a strong case that AI might bring more harm than good. Citrini Research highlights growing concerns that AI accelerates wealth inequality and destabilizes the labor market. Older workers lack adaptive capacity to switch roles, facing greater job loss and lower reemployment rates. Paradoxically, AI seems to favor experienced workers over younger ones in some sectors, which is unusual compared to past tech revolutions.

          Low-Wage Workers Face the Brunt

          The tech revolution is painful for low-wage workers. AI disrupts entry-level jobs, pushing people into precarious situations. Unlike high-income workers who can relocate or retrain, low-wage workers face long-term disadvantages. Displacement lowers their chances of permanent employment significantly.

          Brian Groh, a freelance writer, lost gigs to AI and moved back to Ohio to cut costs. When AI suggested he start woodwork, he tried it but eventually injured his back. Offered painkillers to keep working, he feared falling into a cycle that claimed many lives in his town. His story highlights the human cost behind AI-driven job losses.

          Jobs like secretaries, cashiers, front desk attendants, and customer service reps are most vulnerable to AI automation. Millions of workers perform repeatable tasks soon to be replaced by machines, with few skills to transition to new roles. This creates a looming crisis for low-skilled workers trying to re-enter an AI-infused workforce.
