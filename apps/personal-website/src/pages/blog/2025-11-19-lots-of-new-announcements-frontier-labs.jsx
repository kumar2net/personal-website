          Anticipating Major Announcements from Frontier Labs
        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">

            As we approach the Thanksgiving weekend, I sense that major announcements from all the Frontier Labs are on the horizon. These labs are pushing the boundaries, much like Kadothgajan yearning for more compute capacity. Reflecting on their progress, I believe 2026 will serve as a crucial litmus test for their advancements. Today, if I were to list my top five Frontier Labs, I would focus on those driving innovation and breakthroughs in AI and computing power.

          Our Shared Responsibility to Reduce Carbon Footprint
        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Regardless of the agreements or disagreements in the tech world, it is imperative that each of us contributes to reducing our carbon footprint. I recall Dr. Abdul Kalam's inspiring words: "Don't ask what your country has done for you — ask what you can do for your country." This quote reminds me that individual contributions, no matter how small, are vital in creating a sustainable future for all.

          Imagining a Future with AGI and Automation
        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            What happens when Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is achieved and automation takes over all mundane tasks? Robots will handle our sundry jobs, and yet, we might find ourselves endlessly scrolling on screens, passing time without purpose. It's a scenario that challenges us to rethink how we engage with technology and find meaningful ways to spend our time in an automated world.

          The Evolution of Skills and Interfaces in the Digital Age
        </h2>
        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Skills like typing at high speeds, shorthand writing, stenography, speaking multiple languages, mastering grammar and vocabulary, or converting metric to imperial units have become somewhat obsolete. We no longer need to memorize such details. What remains is the need to evolve beyond our current mobile devices and their touch-and-click interfaces. The future lies in natural voice and vision interfaces that work reliably. For example, the recent Lenskart IPO in India grabbed attention by showcasing spectacles that can make payments via UPI simply by looking at a shopkeeper's QR code—a glimpse into the seamless integration of technology in everyday life.
