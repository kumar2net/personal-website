# 15 Book Nuggets for Gen Z & Millennials

1. **System 1 vs System 2 (Kahneman)** — Fast instincts write the first draft; slow thinking must audit. If a decision feels too easy, trigger a checklist.
2. **WYSIATI** — What you see isn’t all there is. Hunt for missing data before you commit (anchors, base rates, rare-event math).
3. **Loss aversion** — We overpay to avoid loss; pre-set rules (budgets, defaults) beat willpower in the moment.
4. **Service over self (It’s Not About You)** — Meaning compounds when you improve others’ lives; happiness is a byproduct.
5. **Legacy > lifespan** — Your time is finite; your contributions aren’t. Build things and relationships that outlive you.
6. **Authenticity beats approval** — Your inner voice > crowd noise. Curate a small circle; ignore ambient critics.
7. **Silence the inner heckler** — Kill the “you can’t” loop fast; replace it with one actionable next step.
8. **Stoic controllables** — Own effort, not outcomes. Practice courage, justice, temperance, wisdom daily.
9. **Choose better problems (Subtle Art)** — Finite “care” budget: allocate to values, not vanity.
10. **Brain hygiene** — Attention is a bottleneck; sleep, movement, and single-tasking make learning stick.
11. **Ethics without scaffolds (Atheism notes)** — Live evidence-first; be kind and skeptical without needing supernatural backup.
12. **Cornell method** — Split page into cues/notes/summary; review within 24 hours; turn cues into recall prompts.
13. **3D living** — Rotate curiosity, exploration, and hands-on experience; protect unstructured time for serendipity.
14. **Summarize, don’t hoard highlights** — Write your own gist after each read; convert one insight into a small habit.
15. **Scarcity stories** — From water crises to nature tales: good narratives show stakes and stewardship. Design for conservation and fairness.
