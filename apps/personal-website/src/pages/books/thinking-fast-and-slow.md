Key Concepts of 
Thinking, Fast and Slow Kahneman aligns humans’ two distinct modes of thinking—fast and slow—
with two “agents,” which he calls System 1 and System 2. We constantly switch between the two when
making decisions and judgments, frequently falling prey to the biases and illusions that define the
difference between humans and Econs—the unified, rational agents of traditional economics, who
consistently act in their own best interest. Kahneman also identifies two selves—the remembering self
and the experiencing self—when people talk about their lives.

I. SYSTEM 1 AND SYSTEM 2 Two agents handle human thinking: System 1 and System 2. Busy System 1
is fast, is intuitive, and cannot be turned off; it engages the automatic mental activities of perception
and memory. Sluggish System 2 handles slow, effortful, deliberate thinking and is lazy. When System 1
presents a plausible story, System 2 will often pass it through uncritically. One may believe a rational
choice has been made, when in fact it was not. Kahneman looks mostly at System 1 and explores how it
relates and interacts with System 2. 
Nice way of explaining this concept

System 1 is constantly sorting through feelings and memories to make suggestions to System 2, the
decision maker. Usually, this process serves one well. However, System 1 tends to have biases, and relies
on the most readily available answers, which can cause judgment errors System 2 can’t detect. System 2
is too slow to sort through every decision, and so the two end up compromising. In fact, System 2 can
seem reluctant to exert more effort than necessary to complete tasks. But there are some tasks that only
System 2, “the working mind,” can perform, such collecting and analyzing data to make rational
decisions. When System 2 is at work, it shows: the pupils dilate, the heart rate increases, and the
inability to see anything other than the required task takes hold. These are the physical signs of
cognitive strain, a mental state that makes one literally stop and think in order to reallocate energy
from other tasks while System 2 performs the work involved in making choices.

1 can’t determine what data is necessary, it draws conclusions based on the nearest associative data and
readily leaps to a conclusion that favors its first bias. Kahneman calls this What You See Is All There Is,
or WYSIATI—a pervasive System 1 tendency that induces cognitive ease. If System 2 is not jolted out of
cognitive ease, it will likely endorse the false conclusion. So thinking fast makes one overconfident in
quick decisions that ignore critical data for the sake of reinforcing a first impression.

from itself. Applying the Concept • Stop and think. The next time you’re tempted to send a text message
while driving, think twice. Kahneman’s research shows that it’s possible to carry out two simple
activities at the same time under cognitive ease, such as driving and humming a tune. However,
performing a series of more complicated tasks—such as picking up a phone, opening an app, and typing
a message—engenders cognitive strain, forcing one to literally stop and think as System 2 channels
energy toward completing each task.

Math is not hard. Engaging System 2 is draining. In fact, if a task becomes too difficult, one’s pupils
contract, and System 2 seems to give up, like an overloaded circuit breaker—or like a kid struggling with
math. You can avoid this overload by breaking down tasks, or math problems, into multiple easy steps.
If your child is struggling with a problem, simplify it to the point that it would be impossible not to
understand, and then praise her when she gets the right answer. You’ll help her overcome System 2’s
lazy tendencies, and you’ll build confidence in her abilities. • Buy what you need. Grocery stores know
about anchoring. In-store promotions are designed to get you to buy more than you might need. The
next time you see “three lemons for one dollar” at the store, go against the anchor and buy only one, if
that’s all you need. You’ll pay only thirty-three cents for it.

Loss aversion can cause people to expend more effort to avoid loss than to achieve gains, even when loss
is unlikely. Similarly, people often overweight the probability of rare events in decision making.

Kahneman says a better way to alleviate regret is to explicitly anticipate it. If the outcome is bad,
remembering that one considered the possibility of regret beforehand will decrease its effect.

Hold the flame retardant. You’ve probably noticed all kinds of businesses attempting to upsell you, be it
in a restaurant—Do you want fries with that?—or mattress stores. The latter often use narrow framing
to try to convince you to pay for a flame retardant spray. Don’t fall for it. 
Yes I fall for this

Kahneman believes people possess two selves: the self that experiences and the self that reports about it.
These two selves are remarkably distinct. What one actually experiences and what one ultimately
remembers are two very different things—especially when it comes to happiness.

Memory is not the ideal resource to consult to review the past for decisions about the future. 
Yes agree

Kahneman developed the U-index. The U-index measures the percentage of time one spends per day in
an unpleasant state: four hours of a sixteen-hour day in an unpleasant state gives a U-index of 25
percent. If two of those hours are spent commuting to and from work, one could move closer to the
office and cut that U-index in half. But happiness is complicated. Focusing on experienced well-being to
measure happiness ignores the importance of life satisfaction to the remembering self. And focusing on
one’s overall life satisfaction ignores the importance of experienced well-being.
