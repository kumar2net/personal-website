# Hints: Writing Tips Compilation

Main point candidate: The only job of a sentence is to pull the reader to the next one.

Notes:
- Simple writing persuades. Five clean sentences beat a clever hundred.
- Cut extra words. "Very" adds nothing.
- First sentence must grab. Rewrite until it does.
- Short sentences. One thought per sentence when possible.
- Active voice is easier to imagine. Subject before action.
- Clear writing comes from clear thinking.
- Prefer short, common words over fancy words.
- Do not end with a summary. End with a line that surprises but feels right.
- Rewriting is the essence. Cut hard and read aloud.
