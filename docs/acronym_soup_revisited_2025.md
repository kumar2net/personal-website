Intro  
FANG became FAANG, then MAAMA. By mid-2025 the Street talks about the "Magnificent 7": Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla—today's power cluster for tech, markets and policy.

Why the List Changed  
• AI, cloud and autonomy rewired business models.  
• Nvidia & Tesla's multi-trillion-dollar leaps forced expansion.  
• Acronyms give investors a shortcut to complex shifts.

What Each Brings (one-liner snapshot)  
• Apple — Spatial computing & wearables.  
• Microsoft — Copilot-everywhere, Azure AI.  
• Alphabet — Gemini Ultra, Waymo driver-out fleets.  
• Amazon — Bedrock + Trainium-2 = default enterprise AI stack.  
• Meta — Llama 3, smart-glasses social layer.  
• Nvidia — GPU Chips  
• Tesla — FSD ( Full Self Driving), EVs as rolling robots

Energy Red Flag  
Every LLM prompt drinks ~0.1–0.3 Wh (Watt Hour); volumes are doubling. On that curve we'll need mid-country-sized power plants within five years—just as Google delays its carbon-neutral pledge. Floating solar panels (China) may starve river ecosystems; India's 28 °C AC cap shows how quickly comfort gets regulated when grids strain. The test: mint clean terawatt-hours without frying the planet.

Common-Person Takeaways  
1. Higher Bills – AI's energy tab flows into subscriptions, gadgets, utilities.  
2. Platform Lock-In – Daily life runs inside seven walled gardens; know your exit routes.  
3. Carbon Math – Every AI interaction consumes energy; small choices compound into significant environmental impact.  
4. Lifestyle Rules – Governments will implement energy-saving regulations like India's 28°C AC mandate.  
5. Skills – Prompt craft and data literacy are becoming basic employability.




Wrap-Up  
From four letters to seven, acronym creep mirrors the concentration of tech power. Watch who joins—or drops off—the list next; tomorrow's soup will be seasoned by breakthroughs we can scarcely imagine today.

I'll help you create a new flashcard component for the tech buzzwords and update the Learning page to include it. Here's my plan:

1. Remove the table from the markdown file
2. Create a new TechBuzzwords.jsx component following the VimShortcuts pattern
3. Add it to the Learning page flashcard sets

Let me start with the markdown file rewrite:
