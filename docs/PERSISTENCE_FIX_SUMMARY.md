# Blog Interactions Persistence Fix

## Problem
The likes and comments were not persisting across page reloads, function restarts, or deployments because the original implementation used `/tmp/blog-interactions.json` for storage, which is ephemeral in serverless environments.

## Solution Implemented
Migrated from file-based storage in `/tmp` to **Netlify Blobs**, a persistent key-value storage service provided by Netlify.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`netlify/functions/blog-interactions.js`)
- **Removed**: File system operations using `fs` module and `/tmp` directory
- **Added**: Netlify Blobs integration using `@netlify/blobs` package
- **Updated**: All storage operations to use async Blob storage methods
- **Result**: Data now persists permanently in Netlify's cloud infrastructure

### 2. Key Implementation Details
```javascript
// Before (Ephemeral)
const DATA_FILE = '/tmp/blog-interactions.json';
fs.writeFileSync(DATA_FILE, JSON.stringify(data));

// After (Persistent)
const store = await getBlobStore(context);
await store.setJSON('data', data);
```

### 3. Benefits of Netlify Blobs
- ✅ **True Persistence**: Data survives function restarts, deployments, and server migrations
- ✅ **No Database Required**: Built into Netlify platform
- ✅ **Automatic Management**: No maintenance or backups needed
- ✅ **Global Distribution**: Fast access from anywhere
- ✅ **Scalable**: Handles growing data without performance issues

## How It Works

1. **Storage Structure**: All likes and comments are stored in a single JSON blob with the key `'data'`
2. **Automatic Provisioning**: Netlify automatically creates and manages the blob store
3. **Context-Based Access**: Uses the Netlify function context to authenticate and access the blob store
4. **Fallback Handling**: Returns empty data structure if no data exists yet

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run Netlify dev server (required for blob storage)
netlify dev

# In another terminal, run the test script
npm run test:interactions
```

### Production Testing
After deployment, interactions will automatically persist. You can verify by:
1. Liking a post
2. Adding a comment
3. Refreshing the page
4. Checking that likes and comments are still there

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data
If you had any existing data in the old `/tmp` storage, it will be lost after deployment. The new system starts fresh with Netlify Blobs.

### No Configuration Required
Netlify Blobs work out of the box with no additional configuration. The platform automatically:
- Provisions the blob store
- Handles authentication
- Manages the infrastructure

## Troubleshooting

### If persistence isn't working:
1. **Ensure you're using Netlify Functions**: The blob storage only works in Netlify's environment
2. **Check deployment logs**: Look for any errors related to blob storage
3. **Verify the package is installed**: `@netlify/blobs` should be in dependencies
4. **Test with the provided script**: Run `npm run test:interactions` to verify the API

## Files Modified
- `/netlify/functions/blog-interactions.js` - Updated to use Netlify Blobs
- `/docs/BLOG_INTERACTIONS_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation
- `/package.json` - Added test script
- `/scripts/test-blog-interactions.mjs` - Created test script

## No Frontend Changes Required
The React component (`BlogInteractions.jsx`) didn't need any changes as it already communicates with the backend API correctly.
