Pressing issue at Naruvi Gated Community: High usage of RO Water
metrics: 26000 litres per day, 35 occouped villas, approx. assumtion 3 persons per villa, calculation 26000/35/3 = 222 litres per person per day, 
what is the WHO recommendation?

Where water is accessible through a single on-plot tap or within 100 m (5 minutes), usage rises to about 50 litres per person per day, meeting higher hygiene needs.

Optimal access (multiple taps, continuous supply) supports over 100 litres per person per day, covering all domestic and hygiene requirements.

Key values:

Absolute minimum for drinking: 5.3 L/person/day

Basic minimum for all basic domestic purposes (excl. laundry, bathing): 20 L/person/day

Intermediate for full hygiene/practical needs: 50 L/person/day

Optimal indoor service: >100 L/person/day

Then we need to add delta for plants waterring, car and outdoor area cleaning etc..

What is the Solution: Use Borewell water untreated for non-potable uses and RO water for potable uses.
Potable use: Cooking, bathing, washing, drinking
Non-potable use: Plants watering, car washing, outdoor area cleaning etc..

Using Existing Single Plumbing Line (With Valves and Controls):

The reject water can be introduced into the existing single plumbing line but routed only to dedicated non-potable points (toilets, garden taps, washing machine) using manual or automatic mixing valves at each point or common manifold.

Potable water points (kitchen taps, showers, drinking water outlets) are fed only with permeate water by installing check valves and backflow preventers to avoid cross contamination.

This requires installing isolating valves and clear labeling inside homes to ensure residents use reject water only at suitable outlets.

Less costly and disruptive, suitable for communities with moderate plumbing modification scope.
Summary:
For retrofit in existing homes, using the single plumbing line with valves and backflow preventers for controlled reject water usage is feasible and cost-effective.

Clear signage, user education, and periodic supervision are critical to avoid misuse or contamination.

Total Estimated Cost Range: ₹5,75,000 to ₹6,75,000 (~USD 7,000 - 8,200)
Additional Remarks:
Costs are approximate and can vary based on contractors, material quality, and market fluctuations in Coimbatore.

RO plant operational costs (power, membrane replacement) are additional and should be considered separately.

Capital cost amortization and water savings will likely give an ROI of 2–3 years depending on current water tariffs.

Getting multiple local quotes is recommended for competitive pricing and vendor support.

This cost covers necessary equipment, materials, installation, plumbing retrofit inside homes, and control systems to implement an efficient reject water reuse solution on your existing single plumbing line in Naruvi.
