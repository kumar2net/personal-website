Pressing issue at Naruvi Gated Community: High usage of RO Water
metrics: 26000 litres per day, 35 occouped villas, approx. assumtion 3 persons per villa, calculation 26000/35/3 = 222 litres per person per day, 
what is the WHO recommendation?

Where water is accessible through a single on-plot tap or within 100 m (5 minutes), usage rises to about 50 litres per person per day, meeting higher hygiene needs.

Optimal access (multiple taps, continuous supply) supports over 100 litres per person per day, covering all domestic and hygiene requirements.

Key values:

Absolute minimum for drinking: 5.3 L/person/day

Basic minimum for all basic domestic purposes (excl. laundry, bathing): 20 L/person/day

Intermediate for full hygiene/practical needs: 50 L/person/day

Optimal indoor service: >100 L/person/day

Then we need to add delta for plants waterring, car and outdoor area cleaning etc..

What is the Solution: Use Borewell water untreated for non-potable uses and RO water for potable uses.

**Technical Context:**
- RO systems typically have 50% efficiency - permeate (clean water) is 50% of input, reject water is 50%
- Borewells are typically sunk to 300-500 feet depth to access groundwater
- Current system uses 100% RO water, resulting in significant waste of reject water

**Energy Consumption Analysis:**
| Component | Power (kW) | Hours/Day | Energy/Day (kWh) | Monthly Energy (kWh) |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Borewell Pump | 4 | 10 | 37.3 | 9,567 |
| RO High-Pressure Pump | 10 | 10 | 100 | 25,650 |
| Common Area Lighting | 4 | 10 | 40 | 10,260 |
| **Total** | | | **177.3** | **45,477** |

**Key Parameters:**
- Electricity Tariff (Rs/kWh) - TNPDCL Energy: ₹9
- TNPDCL Fixed Charge: ₹214 per kW per 2 months
- Fixed cost TNPDCL: ₹4,280
- Total estimate TNPDCL cost: ₹49,757
- RO Plant Daily Output: 29,000 litres permeate (58,000 litres input)
- Pump Runtime to meet Output: 10 hours actual
- Common Area Lighting Runtime: 10 hours

**RO Efficiency Calculation:**
With 50% efficiency, we need 58,000 litres of input water to get 29,000 litres of permeate per day.

**Cost Analysis:**
Electricity cost for RO Water: 67% of total energy consumption

Potable use: Cooking, bathing, washing, drinking
Non-potable use: Plants watering, car washing, outdoor area cleaning etc..

Using Existing Single Plumbing Line (With Valves and Controls):

The reject water can be introduced into the existing single plumbing line but routed only to dedicated non-potable points (toilets, garden taps, washing machine) using manual or automatic mixing valves at each point or common manifold.

Potable water points (kitchen taps, showers, drinking water outlets) are fed only with permeate water by installing check valves and backflow preventers to avoid cross contamination.

This requires installing isolating valves and clear labeling inside homes to ensure residents use reject water only at suitable outlets.

Less costly and disruptive, suitable for communities with moderate plumbing modification scope.
Summary:
For retrofit in existing homes, using the single plumbing line with valves and backflow preventers for controlled reject water usage is feasible and cost-effective.

Clear signage, user education, and periodic supervision are critical to avoid misuse or contamination.

Total Estimated Cost Range: ₹5,75,000 to ₹6,75,000 (~USD 7,000 - 8,200)
Additional Remarks:
Costs are approximate and can vary based on contractors, material quality, and market fluctuations in Coimbatore.

RO plant operational costs (power, membrane replacement) are additional and should be considered separately.

Capital cost amortization and water savings will likely give an ROI of 2–3 years depending on current water tariffs.

Getting multiple local quotes is recommended for competitive pricing and vendor support.

This cost covers necessary equipment, materials, installation, plumbing retrofit inside homes, and control systems to implement an efficient reject water reuse solution on your existing single plumbing line in Naruvi.
