# It Is Already November

Today's editorial page in *The Hindu* framed November's mood with a quietly alarming observation about where the country finds itself now. It felt like a nudge to look past the day-to-day noise and examine the policies shaping our reality, especially the ones that sound undeniably aspirational on paper.

## The Policy Paradox in the Skies

UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is a genuine people's story. Affordable tickets have opened the skies to passengers from smaller cities who once saw air travel as something other people did. Yet the same policy that democratises mobility fuels an uncomfortable climate ledger.

### UDAN milestones, 2016-2025

| Milestone | Scale |
| --- | --- |
| Routes brought online | 625 across 90 airports, 15 heliports, and 2 water aerodromes |
| Flights operated | 300,000 |
| Passengers served | 14.9 million |
| Viability Gap Funding disbursed | ₹4,023 crore |

Short-haul hops are the least carbon-efficient journeys we can take, and UDAN is almost entirely short-haul by design. Using cBalance's India-specific emission factors, the carbon arithmetic is brutal.

| Mode | CO2e per passenger-km | 500 km trip (kg CO2e per passenger) | Relative impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✈️ Air | 0.285 kg | 142.5 | 🔴 High |
| 🚌 AC bus | 0.070 kg | 35.0 | 🟡 Medium |
| 🚆 Train (AC) | 0.030 kg | 15.0 | 🟢 Low |

Put differently, one typical 500 km flight clocks up roughly the same emissions as five long-distance bus journeys or nine train rides.

### Counting the hidden costs

A conservative back-of-the-envelope calculation (80 passengers per flight, 400 km average leg) puts UDAN's cumulative emissions at about 2.7 million tonnes of CO2, roughly the yearly footprint of 250,000 Indians. When you pair that with the ₹4,023 crore already disbursed as subsidies, the public purse effectively spends around ₹14,700 for each tonne of CO2 emitted. That is not a number climate planners can ignore, even when the social gains are real.

Why does this conflict persist?

- **Developmental equity:** Tier-2 and tier-3 cities deserve faster connections to growth corridors. UDAN delivers that.
- **Infrastructure gaps:** Rail and bus alternatives remain patchy or painfully slow in many of these new destinations.
- **Policy silos:** Aviation expansion and climate action answer to different ministries, so trade-offs rarely sit on the same table.
- **Behavioural incentives:** Subsidised tickets tilt travellers toward flights, even when cleaner modes exist.

Somewhere between these points sits the November dilemma: the policy is simultaneously inclusive and carbon-intensive.

## Reclaiming My Digital Home

Netlify paused my site this week, freemium realities catch up eventually, so I finally bought my own domain and redeployed everything. I even recorded a quick screen capture to remember the moment ([watch the Loom clip](https://www.loom.com/share/1ac97d75d4d347bb9afb287ebd25b8a6)). The rebuild pushed me to polish the news desk at [kumar2net.com/news](https://kumar2net.com/news), which now holds just the topics I care about and remembers them across the session.

Owning the domain feels like a small but necessary step in keeping this space resilient, especially when platforms tighten quotas without warning.

## Little Joys: Images, Music, and Kabaddi Knees

If you wander over to `/album` you'll find the latest photos I have been collecting; `/music` now hosts "Cheenikallu," which is fast becoming the soundtrack to these autumn evenings. "Bison" still feels special to me, our local Kabaddi legend immortalised. Growing up in Tirunelveli, we played until our knees were raw against beach sand, because that is how long you stay on the mat when real competition shows up.

November already, but there is time yet to celebrate the things that keep us grounded while we wrestle with policy contradictions in the skies.
