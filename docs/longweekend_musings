title:"What to write this week?"
1. This is a long weekend in India. Few things caught my attention.
2. The textile industry is asking PM through CM to continue negotiate with the great country and help reduce the steep tariff imposed. They are clearly they dont want government subsidy to tide over this crisis. They want market access. Such proud folks these businessmen of Tirupur from where thet export denim jeans.
3. This article in The Hindu was interesting and to the point. Especially i notice in these days of AI and LLMs - ChatGPT, Gemini- they come up with 'Ramayana' for Mahabharata related querries. They like to dump or should i say -spit volumonius amount of words when i ask a simple question. I have to prompt 'give me crisp reply', 'give me 3 bullet point' etc... all the time

4. Our boy youngest travelled the world - Nepal and 3 countries in Europe making full use of his gap year and his album link is as below. He has nicely explained in each image lots of uesful information. Hope you all read the info he keyed in his Nepal Adventures album. He just landed in Rayleigh, NC and will start his under grad studies in a week. i wish him well. All the rigorous NS training for 2 days have made him a fit and strong physically.
