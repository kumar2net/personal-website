### Suggested Fix for "View Project" Button

The "view project" button on your `/projects` page is likely not working because the route for individual projects is not configured correctly. When you click the button, it probably tries to navigate to a URL like `/projects/some-project-id`, but your application doesn't know how to handle that URL.

To fix this, you need to add a dynamic route to your `src/App.jsx` file. This route will tell your application how to render a single project page.

**Here is the corrected code for your `src/App.jsx` file:**

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

// ... other imports
import Home from "./pages/Home"; // Assuming you have a Home component
import About from "./pages/About"; // Assuming you have an About component
import Projects from "./pages/Projects"; // Assuming you have a Projects component
import Project from "./pages/Project"; // Assuming you have a Project component for single projects

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      {/* ... other routes */}
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/projects" element={<Projects />} />
      <Route path="/projects/:projectId" element={<Project />} />
      {/* ... other routes */}
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Instructions:**

1.  Open your `src/App.jsx` file.
2.  Replace the entire content of the file with the code above.
3.  Make sure you have the following components created:
    *   `src/pages/Home.jsx`
    *   `src/pages/About.jsx`
    *   `src/pages/Projects.jsx`
    *   `src/pages/Project.jsx`
4.  If your components are in a different location, you will need to adjust the import paths accordingly.

**If the issue persists:**

If the "view project" button still doesn't work after applying this fix, I will need to see the code for your `Projects` component. Please provide the content of the file that renders the `/projects` page (likely `src/pages/Projects.jsx`). This will help me to debug the issue further.
