topic for new blog post:Sobering week
the news of Hanu's (thats how JK calls her) still rankling in my mind.
She had to fly to india to be with the grieving family from endinburgh where RJ has gone for a well deserved break. They and AJ took a trip ( West coast drive) is pretty good. All these 3 boys are grinding hard. All these geo polical happenings, tariff, AI impact on world - there is a lot happening. All i would recommend is keep 6 month expenses in emergency fund & play Bold.
Our boy youngest took me on video chat and showed me around his dorm in Uni. So nice to hear from him- excited tones, the frills of college life in the great country. The Prof's encourage students with seminars, group discussions, asking them put the phone and other distractions far away. Even keeping it on the table will distract you. Read the book for 5 hours etc...They are taking them on a field trip to DC in few weeks. So diiferent form the Rote learning we do in india especially. 
Yesterday The Hindu editorial had an article ( Indian democratic dividend as a time bomb) - it says 40 to 50% of Indian Engineering grads in the past decade are not placed in jobs! More and more youngsters are going to college but employers report difficulty in finding the right talent with skills.
