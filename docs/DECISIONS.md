## Recorded decisions & assumptions
1. **Archived prior docs wholesale** — Every file formerly under `docs/` (Markdown, diagrams, misc assets) was moved to `docs/_archive/20251112T010531Z` before generating this set to satisfy the Fresh-Docs policy and avoid mixing legacy content.
2. **Keep Vite-mounted API shim** (`apps/personal-website/vite.config.js`) — Local dev pipes `/api/convert` and `/api/semantic-search` requests into the actual serverless handlers. This avoids stubbing conversions or search results in the UI and ensures Vite exercises the same semantic-index-backed code paths that production uses.
3. **Ship a JSON semantic index for search** (`scripts/build-semantic-index.mjs` + `apps/personal-website/api/semantic-search.js`) — Instead of depending on hosted vector search services, we snapshot embeddings plus metadata into `src/data/semantic-index.json` and run cosine math in pure Node.js. The artifact stays small enough for Git, works everywhere, and we don’t maintain a lexical-only fallback layer.
4. **Topic suggestions allow synthetic data** (`backend/services/recommendationService.js`) — `RECOMMENDER_DEV_MODE` injects seeded topics when GA4 exports are absent. This avoids blocking the `/topics` route during local work but is clearly labeled (`mock: true`) so we keep user expectations in check.
5. **Generations merge tolerates missing OpenAI/KV** (`apps/personal-website/api/generations/merge.ts` & `chronicle.ts`) — If `OPENAI_API_KEY` or KV creds are not present, the API emits fallback chronicles and a `tokenUsage.source = "fallback"` payload. This was intentionally preserved to unblock journaling UX while infrastructure secrets are withheld.
6. **Webhook UI is disabled by design** (`src/services/webhookService.js`) — The service hardcodes `webhookUrl = null`, so the management UI (`components/WebhookIntegration.jsx`) acts as a preview only. We declined to stub fake endpoints to avoid accidentally leaking analytics events to the wrong host; enabling it will require a dedicated backend route plus credential storage.
7. **TL;DR runs through `/api/tldr` with OpenAI + heuristic fallbacks** — We replaced the Netlify-only function with a Vercel/Node handler so production traffic stays on the same origin. The hook still honors `VITE_TLDR_ENDPOINT` for overrides, and falls back to the legacy Netlify path during migrations.
8. **Graph recommender can disappear silently** (`src/components/GraphRecommendations.jsx`) — Components short-circuit until `GNN_API_BASE_URL` responds with `initialized: true`. This behavior was kept because it allows shipping the SPA even when the Python GNN service is offline; we prefer hidden widgets over hard failures.
