blog title:Rise from F***
This malayalam song really inspired me and I think the link didn't come off properly in my recent wordpress blog.

The song immediately establishes that there is a destined and unwavering path (Niyatham margam) marked by the occurrence of a fierce, intense moment (Pathitham theevram). This path is constantly narrated as a single, unchanging doctrine (Eka matham). The text asserts that the blazing or purification (Jwalanam poorvam) and the complete, intense struggle (Madhanam poornam) have already taken place, leaving an essence like a sacred tradition (Smruthivat saaram) within the history of an entire era (Yuga charitham). The struggle to uphold this path requires that a thousand sins must be performed or faced (Karaneeyam sahasram paapam), demanding mental restraint and suffering according to the rules of life (Manarodham vidhivat thaapam). The purpose is to speak the truth that is distant and deeply rooted (Vadaneeyam vidhuram roodam) on a path known as that of this earthly world (ihalokaakhyam). Navigating this life, afflicted by the mix of happiness and sorrow, makes the story extremely harsh, even though the universal law is made in many diverse forms (Niyamam bahuvidha roopakrutham). The ultimate victory comes from recognizing that the Earth is righteous and that Truth must be in action/duty (Sathyam cha karmanye). This duty must be performed only with the mind and pure intention (Manasenaiva tat kuryaath), by which one may achieve absolute liberation (Kaivalyam cha vaset). The individual soul (Jeevathma), when united with the Self, discipline, and strategy, and having conquered the senses (jithendriya), is definitively liberated from all bondage (Bandho bandhaat pramuchyaathe).

I literally lost count of how many times I had listened to this song and wanted to share the meaning with you all
