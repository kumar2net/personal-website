## Top 10 Famous Rules (with Examples)


I am a great fan of these and wanted to share these with you.


## 1\. Rule of 72

* What it is: Estimates how long it takes for an investment to double, given a fixed annual percentage rate, by dividing 72 by the rate.  
* Example: At 6% annual interest, it takes approximately 9 years for your money to double (72 ÷ 6 \= 12).  
* Einstein's Quote: “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn’t ... pays it.”

## 2\. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

* What it is: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.  
* Example: In business, 80% of sales come from 20% of customers.

## 3\. Murphy’s Law

* What it is: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.  
* Example: If you’re running late, you’ll likely hit every red light.

## 4\. Parkinson’s Law

* What it is: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.  
* Example: Give yourself a week to do a one-hour task, and you’ll take a week to finish it.

---

## 5\. Occam’s Razor

* What it is: The simplest solution is most likely to be correct.  
* Example: If your car won’t start, check if you’re out of gas before assuming a major fault.

---

## 6\. Peter Principle

* What it is: People rise to their level of incompetence.  
* Example: An excellent engineer promoted to manager may not excel in a management role.

---

## 7\. Law of Diminishing Returns

* What it is: Adding more of one factor of production soon yields lower per-unit returns.  
* Example: Studying extra hours might help at first but gives less benefit the longer you go without rest.

---

## 8\. Law of Large Numbers

* What it is: As a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population.  
* Example: Flipping a coin many times will result in about 50% heads and 50% tails.

## 9\. Benford’s Law

* What it is: In many sets of real-life data, the leading digit is likely to be small.  
* Example: In accounting, the number 1 appears as the leading digit about 30% of the time.
