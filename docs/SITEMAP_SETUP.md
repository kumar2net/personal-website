# Sitemap Setup for Google Search Console

This document explains how the sitemap is generated and how to use it with Google Search Console.

## Overview

The sitemap helps search engines discover and index all pages on your website. It's automatically generated based on your React Router routes and includes all static pages and blog posts.

## Files Created

1. **`public/sitemap.xml`** - The main sitemap file
2. **`public/robots.txt`** - Robots file that points to the sitemap
3. **`scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`** - Script to regenerate the sitemap

## Sitemap URL

**Copy this URL for Google Search Console:**
```
https://kumarsite.netlify.app/sitemap.xml
```

## How to Use

### 1. Submit to Google Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps?resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fkumarsite.netlify.app%2F)
2. Add a new sitemap
3. Enter: `https://kumarsite.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Submit"

### 2. Regenerate Sitemap

When you add new blog posts or pages, regenerate the sitemap:

```bash
npm run sitemap
```

Or directly:
```bash
node scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs
```

## What's Included

## Sitemap Structure

- **loc**: Full URL of the page
- **lastmod**: Last modification date (current date when generated)
- **changefreq**: How often the page changes (daily for homepage, weekly for others)
- **priority**: Relative importance (1.0 for homepage, 0.8 for others)

## Verification

You can verify the sitemap is working by visiting:
- https://kumarsite.netlify.app/sitemap.xml
- https://kumarsite.netlify.app/robots.txt

## Adding New Pages

When you add new pages to your React app:

1. Add the route to your `App.jsx`
2. Update the `STATIC_ROUTES` or `BLOG_ROUTES` arrays in `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`
3. Run `npm run sitemap` to regenerate
4. The new page will be included in the next sitemap

## Troubleshooting

### Sitemap Not Found
- Ensure the sitemap is in the `public/` directory
- Check that Netlify is serving the file correctly
- Verify the URL is accessible: `https://kumarsite.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`

### Google Search Console Errors
- Make sure the sitemap URL is exactly: `https://kumarsite.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`
- Check that the XML is valid
- Ensure all URLs in the sitemap are accessible

## Next Steps

After submitting to Google Search Console:
1. Monitor indexing status in Search Console
2. Check for any crawl errors
3. Regenerate sitemap when adding new content
4. Consider submitting individual URLs for important new content
