- PDF conversion: Use `pdftotext` command-line tool to extract text from PDF files (e.g., `pdftotext docs/Atheism.pdf src/pages/books/atheism.txt`).

## üåê Deployment

- Host: Netlify
- Live Site: https://kumarsite.netlify.app
- Branch: Deployed from GitHub. Ensure Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Branch to deploy matches your workflow (main or master).
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

For critical deployment problems like "vite: not found" errors or function versioning conflicts, see:
- **Deployment Troubleshooting**: `docs/DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Covers 2-day debugging session with root cause analysis and solutions
- Includes prevention measures and best practices

## üß† AI TL;DR Summaries

Add concise AI-generated summaries at the top of selected blog posts.

Environment
- Set environment variables in Netlify (Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Environment):
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
  - `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional; default an appropriate GPT-4o mini variant)

Local development
- Use Netlify CLI for local functions:
  - Install: `npm i -g netlify-cli`
  - Run: `netlify dev`
  - App: `http://localhost:8888` (functions proxied at `/.netlify/functions/*`)

How it works
- Backend: `netlify/functions/tldr.js` calls OpenAI Chat Completions to produce a 2‚Äì3 sentence TL;DR.
- Frontend:
  - `src/hooks/useContentText.js` extracts visible article text from a ref
  - `src/hooks/useTldrSummary.js` hashes content, caches via `localStorage`, fetches `/.netlify/functions/tldr`
  - `src/components/TldrSummary.jsx` renders the card
- Integration: posts wrap main content with a `ref` and place `<TldrSummary articleRef={articleRef} />` below title/byline.

Notes
- Only enabled on the three most recent posts by default.
- Caching is client-side only; clear with `localStorage.clear()` if needed.

- **Current Favorites** - Tracks that resonate deeply with personal commentary
- **Complete Lyrics** - Full song lyrics in styled text boxes
- **Artist Spotlights** - Personal favorites with authentic reactions
