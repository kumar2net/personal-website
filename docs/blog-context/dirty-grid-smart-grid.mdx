# From Dirty Grid to Smart Grid: How Storage, SMRs & AI Can Lift India's Efficiency

India’s grid still bleeds nearly one-fifth of its electricity before it reaches consumers. This context file tracks the facts, talking points, and data sources used in the full blog post so we can reuse or refresh them later.

## Diagnostic Snapshot

- **Coal reliance:** ~73% of generation, especially on evening peaks
- **AT&C losses:** 16.12% in FY 2023–24
- **T&D losses:** ≈ 16.6%
- **Curtailment:** ≈ 2% of potential renewable output
- **Grid Efficiency Factor:** 82%, computed as `1 - (AT&C + Curtailment)`

> Nearly one-fifth of generated electricity is never delivered to consumers.

## AI Era Load Growth

- Global AI power draw could reach **8% of global electricity by 2030** (IEA).
- India’s digital buildout pushes demand growth to **7–9% CAGR**, ahead of historical averages.
- Evening peaks intensify without firm clean capacity, risking deeper coal lock-in.

## Storage: First-Line Fix

| Asset | Cost | Key Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BESS (Battery Energy Storage System)** | ₹10.18/kWh (2024 tender), pack cost US$55–80/kWh | Shifts solar from noon to evening, trims curtailment |
| **PHES (Pumped Hydro Energy Storage)** | ₹5–6/kWh (site dependent) | Great for multi-hour shifting; limited by reservoir and topology |

**GEF Impact:**

- Moderate rollout (BESS pilots) → **+2 pp** → 84%
- Aggressive rollout (BESS + ToD tariffs + DSM) → **+4–5 pp** → 86–87%

## Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

- Factory-built <300 MWₑ reactors with ~90% capacity factors
- Can replace retiring coal units on existing transmission corridors
- Provide 24×7 baseload, pairing well with intermittent renewables

**Combined Gains:**

| Scenario | Added GEF Gain | Combined GEF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replace ageing coal with SMRs | +2 pp | 84% |
| SMRs + Storage + Digital Grid | +4–6 pp | 86–88% |

## Benchmark: United States Grid

- T&D losses around **5%**
- Curtailment < 1% thanks to flexible, automated grid control
- **GEF ≈ 95%**

India has to close a 13-point gap relative to the U.S. baseline by reducing losses, adding firm clean capacity, and digitising distribution.

## Notes for Future Updates

- Track falling BESS pack costs quarterly.
- Add real-world SMR pilot status in India (NPCIL, NTPC) once public.
- Update AI power demand numbers with domestic hyperscaler announcements.
