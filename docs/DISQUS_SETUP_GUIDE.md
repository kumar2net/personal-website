# Disqus Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the migration from the custom comment/likes system to Disqus Universal Embed for better performance, reliability, and user experience.

## What Was Removed

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/BlogInteractions.jsx` - Custom React component with like/unlike and comment functionality
- All related animations and UI components

### Backend Services
- `netlify/functions/blog-interactions.js` - Serverless function handling likes/comments
- Netlify Blobs storage for comment data
- All API endpoints for comment management

### Dependencies
- `@netlify/blobs` - No longer needed for comment storage

## What Was Added

### New Components
- `src/components/DisqusComments.jsx` - Lazy-loaded Disqus integration
- Performance optimized with Intersection Observer
- Automatic script loading when component comes into view

### Migration Tools
- `scripts/migrate-to-disqus.mjs` - Automated migration script
- Updates the last 5 blog posts automatically (most recent)
- Preserves existing post IDs and URLs

## Disqus Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Disqus Account
1. Go to [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new site for your blog

### 2. Get Your Shortname
1. In your Disqus admin panel, go to Settings ‚Üí General
2. Note your "Shortname" (e.g., `yourblogname`)
3. This will be used in the embed code

### 3. Update the Component
Edit `src/components/DisqusComments.jsx` and replace:
```javascript
script.src = 'https://your-disqus-shortname.disqus.com/embed.js';
```
with your actual shortname:
```javascript
script.src = 'https://yourblogname.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

### 4. Run Migration
```bash
npm run migrate:disqus
```

This will automatically:
- Update the last 5 blog post imports (most recent)
- Replace `BlogInteractions` with `DisqusComments`
- Generate proper URLs and titles for each post
- Preserve existing post IDs

## Configuration Details

### Disqus Configuration
The component automatically configures:
- `this.page.url` - Canonical URL for the post
- `this.page.identifier` - Unique post ID (preserved from old system)
- `this.page.title` - Post title for Disqus

### Performance Optimizations
