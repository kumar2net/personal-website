## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Content Extraction Challenges
1. **JSX Structure Issues**: Complex nested structures with multiple divs can confuse extraction
2. **Content Length Problems**: Extraction may stop prematurely at closing tags
3. **Class Name Dependencies**: Script looks for specific class names like "prose"
4. **Component Boundaries**: React components may interfere with content extraction

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Simplified JSX Structure**: Flattened nested sections and complex div hierarchies
2. **Clear Content Boundaries**: Used single prose div to contain all content
3. **Manual HTML Posting**: Created direct HTML version for complex content
4. **Content Verification**: Always test content extraction before publishing

### Best Practices for Future Posts
1. **Use Simple JSX Structure**: Avoid deeply nested sections and complex div hierarchies
2. **Single Content Container**: Wrap all content in a single div with "prose" class
3. **Test Content Extraction**: Run `npm run crosspost:extract` to verify content length
4. **Manual Backup**: For complex content, prepare HTML version as backup
5. **Content Verification**: Always check WordPress post after publishing

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Content Length**: If extraction shows < 1000 characters, content may be incomplete
2. **Simplify JSX**: Remove nested sections and complex div structures
3. **Manual HTML**: Create HTML version and post directly via API
4. **Clear Posted Log**: Remove entry from `data/wordpress-posted.json` to repost
5. **Verify Results**: Check WordPress post to confirm full content is displayed
