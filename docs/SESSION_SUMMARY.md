# Session Summary: Disqus Integration + Mobile Fixes + Album Enhancements + Navigation Improvements + Veo 3 Teaser Implementation

**Date:** January 2025  
**Duration:** ~8 hours  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## October 24, 2025
Created "My Reminiscences" blog post from personal content with minimal paraphrasing, featuring beautiful responsive design and sections covering mobile services, finance, cryptocurrency, data science, and cultural reflections. Successfully committed and pushed to repository.

## October 25, 2025
Updated the supporting documentation after fixing the JSX wrapper on "My Reminiscences." Cleaned up the source notes in `docs/myReminiscices.md` so the outline matches the published post and recorded the maintenance work for future reference.

## October 26, 2025
Addressed the Vite build chunk warning by refining the manual chunk strategy in `vite.config.js` and adding a dedicated flashcard icon map so Learning pages only pull the icons they need. Production builds now keep each chunk under the 500 kB threshold. Also updated the service worker to use a network-first strategy for navigation requests (with fresh cache versions) to prevent stale HTML from serving outdated bundles.

## üéì Key Learnings

### Content Extraction Challenges
1. **JSX Structure Issues**: Complex nested structures with multiple divs can confuse extraction
2. **Content Length Problems**: Extraction may stop prematurely at closing tags
3. **Class Name Dependencies**: Script looks for specific class names like "prose"
4. **Component Boundaries**: React components may interfere with content extraction

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Simplified JSX Structure**: Flattened nested sections and complex div hierarchies
2. **Clear Content Boundaries**: Used single prose div to contain all content
3. **Manual HTML Posting**: Created direct HTML version for complex content
4. **Content Verification**: Always test content extraction before publishing

### Best Practices for Future Posts
1. **Use Simple JSX Structure**: Avoid deeply nested sections and complex div hierarchies
2. **Single Content Container**: Wrap all content in a single div with "prose" class
3. **Test Content Extraction**: Run `npm run crosspost:extract` to verify content length
4. **Manual Backup**: For complex content, prepare HTML version as backup
5. **Content Verification**: Always check WordPress post after publishing

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Content Length**: If extraction shows < 1000 characters, content may be incomplete
2. **Simplify JSX**: Remove nested sections and complex div structures
3. **Manual HTML**: Create HTML version and post directly via API
4. **Clear Posted Log**: Remove entry from `data/wordpress-posted.json` to repost
5. **Verify Results**: Check WordPress post to confirm full content is displayed

**Technical Details**:
- Script automatically checks and frees both ports (8888, 5173)
- Provides user-friendly console feedback during cleanup
- Launches Vite dev server with memory optimization (4GB heap)
- Opens browser automatically after successful startup

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/start-dev-clean.sh` - Bash script for automatic port cleanup and dev server launch

**Files Modified**:
