The art style is Ghibli-inspired, with soft, warm colors and a sense of nostalgia. The background is lush with coconut and betelnut trees.  
​Story: In the vibrant town of Tirunelveli, nestled among swaying coconut and towering betelnut trees, lived a bright young boy named Kumar. He was not only the top student in his class, but also a champion on the field. With a cricket bat in hand, he was a force to be reckoned with, and he could send a table tennis ball zipping across the table with a flick of his wrist. But his favorite game was ball badminton, where he'd chase fluffy balls with a passion that lit up his eyes. His grandfather taught the game and played with him and his brothers. His uncle \- RC uncle as he calls him instilled technical inquisitiveness,, hands on troubleshooting, DIYs etc... That he was an Electrical Engineering Graduate made him choose that field.

He was no longer just a boy from Tirunelveli; he was a young man on a mission, ready to conquer the world of technology.

​Illustration notes: Kumar, now nearing 60, is shown sitting in a comfortable chair, with a book on his lap. He is looking out a window, with a gentle smile on his face. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the room. His foot is bandaged, but he is not defined by his illness. The compass is on a table next to him, still glowing, but now it's a symbol of his inner strength. The art style is still Ghibli-inspired, with a focus on the quiet beauty of the moment. The background is a peaceful, domestic scene.  
​Story: As the years passed, the compass of curiosity turned inward. Chronic illnesses, a diabetic ulcer, and low LVEF, slowed his pace and limited his mobility. But his spirit remained as vibrant as ever. He found new ways to explore the world, not with his feet, but with his mind. He began to share his vast world experience with the younger generation, motivating them to embrace the latest AI technologies and stay curious.
