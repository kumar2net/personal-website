Section 1: learnt whats is Jevons paradox. Asked LLM to teach me this:

Prof. LLM: Let‚Äôs look at how the Jevons paradox can apply to renewable energy üîã, specifically with solar panels.

When a homeowner installs a large solar array, they are generating their own electricity, making their power highly efficient and essentially free after the initial installation cost.

If the cost of running an appliance (like air conditioning or a high-powered electric heater) drops to near zero, how might that change the homeowner's consumption habits compared to when they were paying the high retail rate for grid power?

AK: He will run the appliance for more duration which say Aircon means he and family can get better sleep quality and hence feel a lot refreshed next day

Prof. LLM: That's exactly right! You've identified the rebound effect at work.

The homeowner‚Äôs quality of life improves, but their total energy consumption skyrockets.

Here's how the Jevons paradox plays out with solar energy:

Efficiency/Cost Reduction: Solar panels make the marginal cost of running the A/C or heat pump effectively zero.

Behavioral Rebound: The homeowner runs the A/C all day, sets the temperature lower, and buys more electric gadgets, leading to a much higher total demand for electricity than before.

Systemic Impact (The Paradox): This surge in total electricity demand puts pressure on the entire energy system. Even though the source is renewable, the overall increase in demand means:

More materials are needed to build larger solar arrays and batteries to meet the new, higher demand level.

The utility grid might still need to fire up fossil fuel "peaking" plants to cover the new, massive demand load during times when the sun isn't shining.

In short, the efficiency of solar generation doesn't lead to energy conservation; it enables and encourages greater total energy use.

Section 2: Listened to the podcast ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need no (AI) education‚Äù (The Economist Podcasts, Sep 20, 2025). I was asked by our boy youngest to listen to this. It was behind a paywall and he somehow did some magic and gave me access!

Here‚Äôs a succinct summary of the key points from ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need no (AI) education‚Äù (The Economist Podcasts, Sep 20, 2025):

AI is transforming education: In US lecture halls and seminar rooms, students now use AI tools to write essays, solve complex problems, and even make everyday decisions.

Educators face new challenges: Professors are struggling to detect academic dishonesty in new forms as students tap into AI‚Äôs capabilities, often employing ‚Äúinvisible traps‚Äù to counteract cheating.

An education system in crisis: The episode explores how quickly AI is changing the landscape of learning‚Äîsometimes outpacing teachers in writing, reasoning, and teaching skills.

Looking ahead: The podcast asks what the future holds for education when AI can think, write, and teach better and faster than many human instructors.

Broader impact: This AI-driven shift is influencing not just how students learn and remember, but also how they make sense of the world.

This episode is a reflective, critical look at how artificial intelligence is rewiring both the practical and philosophical aspects of modern education, highlighting both opportunity and disruption in the sector.

My 2 cents on this topic: If i am a student I will leverage this to the hilt, use it effectively and score good grades. But at the same time use the techniqies and practises they use in USA Uni's effectively- group discussions, attending and speaking in seminar's, activcely interact with alumni. The Prof's can use all the techniques they want - to catch cheating - but if they want to be relevant they need to adopt the same techniques. All the old ways of exams, grades will be irrelevant if not already.

Section 3: Homeless in SFO
Our boy was so aghast seeing the amount of homeless people in SanFrancisco, Silicon Valley housing some of the biggest tech companies in the world.

This isnt new - I noticed it duing my travels in early 2000's and it was a rude shock to me when i came to SFO from Sunnyvale, Milpitas. i had to catch the return flight had to spend over night in SFO, as didnt want to risk that mid night 101 drive to reach the airport in time. The sight of homeless people sleeping on the streets, in the parks, under bridges was a rude shock to me. Even teen and middle age girls were roaming the streets at night. I am not sure what is the solution to this. But why isnt the CA state couldn't fix it. is it due to:
severe shortage of affordable housing, loss of jobs, limited mental health and addiction services, and persistent failures in both local and federal policy to address these complex issues. Wheter India or the great country what the great port said holds good.

The famous Bharathi quote in Tamil is:

‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Æø ‡Æí‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æâ‡Æ£‡Æµ‡ØÅ ‡Æá‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Øà‡ÆØ‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æú‡Æï‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øà ‡ÆÖ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Øã‡ÆÆ‡Øç

This powerful line means: "If even one person is left without food, we will destroy the world"‚Äîemphasizing the poet's uncompromising commitment to social justice and universal compassion.

When i see this,  the tariff's, geo polical tensions, AI, all these things seem so trivial. The real pain point is the amount of younsters in this situation.

Section 3: It's golu time and nice to observe what the women folks set out to shop for gifts - small giri trading turmeric, kumkum sachets, thamboolam, home made soap to Sundals. Ofcourse we eat couple of varieties of these and fire all cylinders!

kotta pakku still exist! I like the way the beetel nut tree - slim and grow so tall adjacent to coconut tree in our growing up years. Very elegant looking tree and the raw nut used to glow - orange nut with green cap. Touch nut to crack!
