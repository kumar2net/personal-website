i want to crate a blog post on the following topic: Friction in India with government services.
The problem: TNPDCL - Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Company Limited (erstwhile TNEB/ TNGEDCO) can not take energy meter reading on time - bimonthly because of shortage of manpower. When the time for reading comes up our elderly, retired folks get tensed. if the reading is not done on time, they are charged extra as the slab rate is higher. This matters so much to them.
The issue i am facing which led to this post: They keyed in some random 260 odd units - kwH - in my account during the last billing cycle. Multiple phone calls, emails, raising tickects in their mobile app, etc.doesnt help. i sent video of meter reading -kwH, kvA et... as they typically ask. it is 3 weeks since i have been trying to get this resolved and it is still not done. i set out to find the root cause.
what i found: we are still in archaic manual meter reading system where as the world has moved to automated meter reading system.
Advantages of automated meter reading system vs manual meter reading system:
do deep research and find return on investment of automated meter reading system.both capex and opex. including retrofit topions to Genus energy meters and recommend best RF t4chnology to use. I think they sohuld leverage the existing infrastructure and use the existing infrastructure to their advantage of airtel or reliance or bsnl or any other telecom operator.
what to do in the imterim. in mobile app use NFC to read data from the meter and get it verified by the customer and send it to billing system. Almost all our younsters can do this and it will help reduce the workload of the field staff.








the types of energy meters used in few countries are in the @docs/enerymeter/enerfyMetercomp.csv - use it verbatim
