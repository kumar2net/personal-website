blog topic:my reminiscices
1. First was with our boy working for the mobile service provider for whom I played a part in Nokia providing managed services to them. So interesting to hear him out dabbling around a bit in ML. Vodafone India is now majority owned by Governemnt of India at almost 50%. How things changed - wehn they are British onwed the folks from UK - the parent company used to come and demand so much for so little! But they were a lot nicer than the current Indian major mobile duos. These were absolute penny pinchers wrt paying vendors for products/ services
2. It was pretty interesting to hear the other fam girl - she said 2 decades in Financial industry currerntly! They both seem to assume I know a lot in AI - but nice to talk to her about 'disintermediation' happening thick and fast in her industry.
3. Bitcoin and Ethereum are my favrourite subsjects from a few years and I do track them while being aghast at  all the regulatory mud/ shade which is thrown at them. But they are losing the battle thich and fast.
4. Our Data Scientist boy in Birmingham is coming up with nice insights/ actionable data in charts for his company sales, marketing team folk and dabbling around with ML algo's too which is very critical. 
5. Senior most boy is coming to terms with the vagaries of hostile valley life and I am sure he will fight it out.
6. But the common theme I notice is - its tough life and they all are fighting and working hard which is so pleasing to me when observing from afar.
