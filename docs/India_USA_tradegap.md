## **üìù Summary:**

India--U.S. trade reached historic heights in 2024 with total trade of
\$212.3B. Goods trade shows a significant U.S. trade deficit of \$45.8B.
Indian exports were growing strongly in 2025, but recent tariff
escalations---first 25%, now doubled to 50%---have introduced a major
disruption, primarily triggered by India's Russian oil imports.
