Little things stay with us, remain with us over the years. The sound of a broom, the small hand-broom,
sweeping the steps or verandah takes me back to that distant but vivid childhood, and the thin dark
woman who swept the bungalow’s rooms and verandah. I loved watching her at work. It seemed like a
game to me and sometimes I would take the jharoo from her and sweep so vigorously that the dust rose
and settled on the furniture. ‘Mem-sahib will be angry,’ she’d say, and take the broom away from me.
But she’d let me borrow it from time to time, when my parents weren’t around!

And you, dear reader, will have similar impressions to carry with you all your days. That first day at
school, maybe an agonising parting from your parents. The face of a loved one lost. A pullover knitted
by your granny. A favourite toy. A doll, perhaps. A book of rhymes, tattered and torn. Someone who
gave you a flower, a kiss on the forehead. To the end of your days you will carry that kiss with you. And
may it protect you from all harm.

Sea-shells. They are among my earliest memories. I was five years old, walking barefoot along the
golden sands of a Kathiawar beach, collecting shells and cowries and taking them home to fill up an old
trunk. Some of these shells have remained with me through the years. I still have one which I place
against my ear to listen to the distant music of the Arabian Sea. A jackfruit tree. It stood outside my
grandfather’s house in Dehra Dun: it was easy to climb and generous with its shade and in its trunk was
a large hole where I kept my

marbles, sweets, prohibited books and other treasures. I have always liked the smell of certain leaves,
perhaps even more than the scent of flowers. Crushed geranium and chrysanthemum leaves, mint and
myrtle, lime and neem trees after the rain, and the leaves of ginger, marigolds and nasturtiums. Of
course, there were other smells which as a boy I especially liked—the smells of pillau and kofta, curry,
hot jalebis, roast chicken and fried prawns. But these are smells loved most by gourmets (and most
boys) and are not as personal as the smell of leaves and grass. I have always liked trains and railway
stations I like eating at railway stations—hot gram, peanut, puris, oranges.
