Here’s an English translation of the Tamil audio lyrics/text in your video: \[1\]

Desire inside as “love” keeps cheating me;    
As “devotion” on the outside, it keeps showing affection towards you. \[1\]  
This act of loving you every day is just a disguise;    
Day by day it only becomes the ruin I bring upon myself. \[1\]

It feels like we have done good to everyone;    
Yet in everything done, there is only selfishness – what a shame. \[1\]  
Enough, enough, enough of this fake drama;    
Let your feet alone become my only guiding star. \[1\]

The heart says it does not want name and fame;    
But the hidden urge to be praised by many still wins as a sly deceit. \[1\]  
The mouth says, “We have conquered lust and anger”;    
Yet inside, likes and dislikes dance wildly, unchecked. \[1\]

It boasts, “We have risen above hunger and taste”;    
But every day the tongue and stomach tie the legs, calling, “Here is food\!”. \[1\]  
Enough, enough, enough of this fake drama;    
Other than the feet of my great sage, nothing else is refuge. \[1\]

The mind has no interest in comfort – that is its state;    
Yet it roams saying, “I have conquered the whole world”. \[1\]  
It forgets the good person who did good, that very same day;    
It bears a mountain of faults and still feels no shame. \[1\]

To those who come, it freely gives advice in abundance;    
But in its own life it stumbles, withers and suffers. \[1\]  
Enough, enough, enough of this fake drama;    
Other than the feet of my great sage, nothing else is refuge. \[1\]

Doing as it wishes is its habit;    
But it says, “It is all your will” – what a strange play. \[1\]  
It vows, “I will live only for you”;    
Then asks, “In return, do this for me” – what a demand. \[1\]

Calling itself an ascetic, it has not renounced anything;    
Perhaps in this birth no true wisdom has yet been born. \[1\]  
Enough, enough, enough of this fake drama;    
Other than the feet of my great sage, in nothing else is refuge.  of my great
