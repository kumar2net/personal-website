# Life in Three Dimensions: How Curiosity, Exploration and Experience Make a Fuller, Better Life

## Big Questions About a Good Life

When Donna Tartt was asked what question sits at the heart of *The Goldfinch*, she responded, “What is a good life? … To be happy oneself? Or is it to make other people happy even at the expense of one’s own happiness?” The prompt is timeless. What even counts as personal happiness? Freedom to do whatever you want? Reaching career milestones? Luxurious rest at a spa or the beach?

## Happiness, Meaning, and Regret

Psychological research suggests that aiming to make others happy is one of the surest routes to our own happiness, while chasing personal happiness directly often backfires. Practices that repeatedly emerge in studies include:

- Prosocial spending and gestures that lift up other people
- Writing gratitude letters and making appreciation explicit
- Leaning into a satisficer mindset—being content with “good enough”—when making everyday choices

Yet a life rooted solely in service can drift toward regret. Action-based regrets dominate in the short term, but inaction grows heavier in hindsight. A person can place everyone else’s needs first and later realize they forfeited their own desires, creating the “bad faith” that Sartre warned about. Morrison’s Nel Wright embodies this sacrifice; Oliver Sacks exemplifies the opposite pole—a life drenched in curiosity, experimentation, and authenticity even amid hardship.

## Hedonic and Eudaimonic Alignment

Some researchers argue that hedonic (pleasure-based) and eudaimonic (meaning-based) well-being overlap so fully that they are nearly indistinguishable, while others simply contend that both matter too much to weigh one over the other. The fragility of happiness reminds us that prosperous lives still contain plenty of illness, danger, and disaster. Meaning hinges on whether life has a “point”—an evident impact, legacy, or reason for existing. When efforts feel pointless, the sense of meaning crumbles, as Lewis Capaldi’s “Pointless” illustrates.

## Psychological Richness: The Third Dimension

Material richness tallies currency; psychological richness tallies experiences. Happiness resembles a batting average that fluctuates game by game, but psychological richness looks more like career home runs—it accumulates. While a psychologically rich life isn’t for everyone, it offers the curious a safety net made of perspective changes rather than comfort.

| Dimension            | Core Features                 | Helpful Metaphors                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Happiness            | Joy, comfort, stability       | Balloon, batting average, sweet chocolate |
| Meaning              | Point, impact, coherence      | Angel, activist, monk                |
| Psychological richness | Novelty, play, perspective shifts | Treasure box, home runs, dark chocolate |

This book argues that a good life does not have to be zero-sum. We can cultivate happiness, meaning, and psychological richness, taking the lessons of each dimension to heart. By valuing the journey—and the stories that pile up along the way—we minimize regrets whether we “stay” or “go.”

## Questions Guiding the Book

The chapters probe questions such as:

- What else contributes to a psychologically rich life?
- Who exemplifies psychological richness in practice?
- How does richness differ from happiness or meaning?
- Do vicarious experiences count, or must we live everything firsthand?
- How can we intentionally enrich life psychologically?

## 1. Life’s Chief Concern

### Happiness as the Ultimate Goal

Aristotle called happiness the “goal of goals,” and William James believed humanity’s chief concern is how to gain, keep, or regain it. Cross-cultural surveys echo the priority: nearly 70% of people rate happiness as extremely important, even ahead of money, love, or health. The research case is strong—happy people tend to be healthier, more prosocial, better workers, and longer-lived.

### Frequency Over Intensity

Happiness rests on how frequently positive events occur, not how intense each event feels. Studies also show that close relationships, not individual accomplishments, drive sustained happiness. In other words, happiness usually equals interpersonal success rather than personal victory laps.

### Cultural Wisdom and Mindsets

Denmark’s global happiness ranking often leads researchers to its culture of low expectations and hygge—the cozy appreciation of small joys. Adopting a satisficer mindset brings peace when buying, planning, or making daily decisions. Still, there is a downside: contentment with the status quo can numb ambition and delay necessary growth. As John, the “Savage” in *Brave New World*, insists, there are moments when embracing discomfort beats accepting “false, lying happiness.”

### Permission to Feel Everything

Constant happiness is neither realistic nor desirable. Sadness, anger, and fear add complexity to our inner lives and often point toward growth. If you’re already content, celebrate it—but also ask whether “good enough” is holding you back from richer experiences. Happiness is only one doorway to a good life; curiosity and courageous exploration fill in the other dimensions that make life feel full and authentic.
