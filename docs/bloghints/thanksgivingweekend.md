# Title: From Thinking Machines to Rudram Mornings — A Week of AI, Insulin, Storytelling, and Nostalgia

## 1. Thinking Machines → AlphaFold → Insulin: The Unexpected Chain Reaction
- Watching *Thinking Machines* impressed me deeply, especially Demis Hassabis’s philosophy: “Solve intelligence → solve biology.”
- AlphaFold’s protein folding breakthroughs feel personal because insulin is a protein with a precise 3D shape.
- Seeing how AI predicts protein structures made me visualize the insulin I rely on every day.
- My diabetes medicines (glimepiride + metformin) finally became clear:
  - Glimepiride: pushes my pancreas to produce insulin.
  - Metformin: improves insulin sensitivity and reduces liver glucose output.
- AI suddenly became not just tech — but a lens to understand my own body.

## 2. Listening to Dan Brown’s *Secret of Secrets* on Audible vs Reading His Paperbacks
- I began listening to Dan Brown’s *Secret of Secrets* on Audible.
- The audiobook experience feels entirely different from reading the paperback:
  - The narrator controls pacing, rhythm, tension, and atmosphere.
  - Symbols like the halo feel more dramatic and vivid.
- Whereas reading gives me:
  - My own mental cinematography, that I am Robert Langden
  - My own tone, character interpretations, and mood.
- It reminded me how the *medium* changes the *mind’s imagination*.
- Another one book which moved me a lot was Steve Jobs	autobiography	by Ian Iacocca. Finished those 500 odd pages in one sitting.

## 3. Ponniyin Selvan: Why the Movie Didn’t Resonate After Reading the Novel
- Having read Ponniyin Selvan in print, I had a rich internal picture of:
  - Arulmozhi Varman
  - Vandhiyathevan
  - Kundavai Pratiyar
  - The Chola world, politics, drama, and tension
- But the movie failed completely for me:
  - The characters looked almost comical compared to the majestic versions in my imagination.
  - Even with an ace director at the helm, the emotional weight didn’t translate.
- A reminder that:
  - Books → imagination dominates.
  - Movies → someone else’s imagination overrides yours.

## 4. Radio Nostalgia — Philips Vacuum Tube → Nelco Tabletop → Sangean Portable
- Thinking about AI and storytelling led me back to memories of three iconic radios in my life:
  - **Philips vacuum tube radio**: slow warm-up hum, glowing tubes, and the crackle before Live cricket commentary and AIR news. The baritone voices of Allen Aubrey, Christopher Martin Jenkins, Jim Maxwell as ofcourse our own Dr. Narottam Puri
  - **Nelco tabletop radio**: a household fixture — not portable, but stable, reliable, and the anchor of our mornings.
  - **Sangean portable radio**: crisp FM sensitivity, rugged, clean tuning — my first truly “carry-it-anywhere” radio.
- These radios shaped my morning rituals long before smart speakers existed.
- Today, Google Home tries to recreate the same feeling — but instead of glowing tubes and analog circuits, it runs on cloud AI and LLM reasoning.
- Yet the emotional core is unchanged: beginning the day with voices, chants, and news.

## 5. Google Home, Gemini Assistant & My Music Playback Frustrations
- After choosing **Gemini** as my assistant:
  - Spotify refused to play Rudram by Kaisinath Sastry.
  - YouTube Music also ignored commands.
- Manual cast worked perfectly — meaning:
  - Gemini’s media-command pipeline is incomplete.
  - The older Google Assistant handled Indian devotional content far more accurately.
- This is not a Spotify Free problem — it’s a “Gemini cannot parse your music requests” issue.

## 6. Why Devotional/Indian Music Fails on Google Home Voice Commands
- Gemini struggles with:
  - Sanskrit titles (Rudram, Chamakam, Sahasranamam)
  - Artist names with variable spellings
  - Tracks with dozens of versions on the same service
- Result:
  - It acknowledges commands but returns no playback.
- YouTube Music failing also confirms it’s NOT licensing — it’s an NLU/entity parsing failure.

## 7. Workarounds That Actually Work
- Manual cast → 100% reliable across Spotify and YouTube Music.
- Use simple English playlist names (e.g., “Rudram Morning”).
- Command: “Hey Google, play the playlist Rudram Morning.”
- Set up routines to bypass Gemini and access the classic Assistant backend.
- Or revert to old Google Assistant for more accurate music commands.

## 8. My New Google Home Routine — Automatic Rudram Every Morning
- Created playlist: **Rudram Morning** with my preferred Rudram version.
- Routine Setup:
  - Trigger: Every day at 6:00 AM.
  - Device: My Google Home/Nest speaker.
  - Action:
    - “Play the playlist Rudram Morning on YouTube Music.”
- Optional routine additions:
  - Weather update
  - All India Radio News
  - Calendar reminders
  - Adjust lights, AC, or fans
- Routines are stable because they use the classic, fully integrated music API.

## 9. Emotional Thread — From Books to Audio to Film to AI Speakers
- This week connected so many themes:
  - Reading Dan Brown vs listening to him on Audible.
  - Reading Ponniyin Selvan vs watching it on film.
  - Philips → Nelco → Sangean → Google Home.
  - AI helping me understand insulin, yet failing to understand my “Play Rudram” request.
- Technology keeps changing:
  - From vacuum tubes to Sangean FM portables to AI speakers.
  - From print novels to audiobooks to movies.
- But the soul of the experience remains:
  - Morning sound.
  - Storytelling.
  - Ritual.
  - Human connection through voice.
