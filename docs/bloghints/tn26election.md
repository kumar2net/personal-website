blog post title: TN Assembley Election 2026
I want to take a back handed humour and complement to the political parties.
it looks so obvious that TVK is just going to split the votes only and that will
aid the ruling DMK.
The AIDMK and BJP may not even win a single seat.
Do a deep psephology and confimr my anaysis wuth charts - total seats, how and
who is popular in a region/ belt etc..
all the data need to be recent
lista all sops promised and its implications
it should be an engrossing read for a gen z and millenial using their lingo
