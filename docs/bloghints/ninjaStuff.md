blog topic title: Ninja Stuff
1. A very few people come across to me as greater than expert and I like the term 'Ninja'. Who are they to me as 2025 comes to a windoff time
    a. Andrej Karpathy - The terms he coins - especially 'Agency' couple of days ago
    b. Charulatha Mani - the way she sxplains swara's in semi0carnatic, film songs - check out couple of her masterpirces in /music paylist
    c. Jofra Archer - fluidity and peotry in motion when he runs up and bowls FAST @150 kmph
2. The podcasters at Guardian Science Weekly are off on vacation till next week and they are re-running some of the most liked episodes. Today they replayed - is curiosity key to aging well. I loved every bit of it and would recommend you to give it a listen when you find time
3. Now that I done listening to Dan Brown's SoS, find 'The Courage to be disliked' quite good. 
    a. Alderian psycology- Humans are driven less by past trauma and more by future goals.
    b. eleology: We’re Pulled by the Future, Not Pushed by the Past

Unlike Freud:

Freud: “Your past trauma made you this way.”

Adler: “What goal is this behavior trying to achieve?”

In Adlerian terms:

Anxiety isn’t just fear → it’s a strategy

Procrastination isn’t laziness → it’s self-protection

Anger isn’t random → it’s a bid for control or respect

This is incredibly empowering because it means:

You can change the goal → and the behavior changes.
    more on this interesting topic early next year when I grasp and able to articulate better
4. When an innocent help at home says we are all - family going to Melmaruvathur for pilgrimage ( for the uninitiated this is similar to Ayyappa vratham and pilgrimage to menfolk). Please just give Rs.11 and want to pray for "அண்ணன்" (Annan) it makes me feel that such day to day positive feelings, emotions and hope keep me going.
5. When I hear Spoorthi Rao, Soorya Gayatthiri on stage during this Marghazhi Music Season - it suddently hit me that indeed lots of water flown under the bridge! They are all versatile single elegantly traversing the tradional carnatic music with medleys and bhajan's and multi-lingual. ARR was mentioning during the December Season inaugation at music academy that he is been trying all these years to get youngster's listen to music
6. Indian ruling government is and maybe doing good stuff but my expectations are much higher. I believe a LOT more can be done if they curb their instinct to 'tom tom' and jingostic show off and concentrate purely on job at hand. Implement policies and framework and monitor them effectively with real time dashboards and punish the folks with iron hand - LKY style.
7. Do checkout some colorful christmas and holiday times decorations at street level sent across by our folks
8. i sign off this year with this gem from 'The Phycology of money' by Morgon Housel:
    At its core, the book reminds us of four simple ideas:
- Don’t be quick in judging others’ spending habits 
- that utility matters more than status;
- that not minimising regret is the biggest risk;
- and that independence is the most valuable thing money can buy

Auf Wiedersehen
