## Module 7 — Markets, Merit, and Moral Limits

### Core Question

**Should everything be for sale?**

### Transcript

Let me start with a simple question: should everything be for sale?

Most of us instinctively say no. But when we examine real cases, that confidence begins to weaken.

Markets are excellent at allocating resources efficiently. The mistake we often make is assuming that efficiency equals moral neutrality. It does not.

Markets don’t just allocate goods. They shape values.

### Two Moral Objections to Markets

1. **The Fairness Objection**  
   Are people choosing freely, or are they choosing under pressure, desperation, or inequality?  
     
2. **The Corruption Objection**  
   Some things are degraded when bought and sold because their meaning changes.

When children are paid to read, reading becomes earning. Once the payment stops, so does the motivation.

### Key Insight

When market logic enters domains like education, health, or citizenship, it changes how we understand them. Civic duty becomes transactional. Care becomes a service.

The real question is not what works, but what kind of society we are becoming.

## Module 8 — What Do We Owe One Another?

### Core Question

Is justice only about fair rules, or also about shared responsibility?

### Transcript

Meritocracy tells a powerful story: work hard, play by the rules, and success will follow.

But talent is not earned. Birth circumstances are not chosen. Even effort depends on conditions we did not design.

Yet meritocracy encourages winners to believe they fully deserve their success, and losers to internalize failure as moral fault.

This produces moral arrogance at the top and humiliation at the bottom.

### Justice Reimagined

Justice is not only about equal opportunity. It is also about solidarity, mutual dependence, and humility.

A healthy society acknowledges that success is a collective achievement.

## Module 9 — Justice, Belonging, and the Common Good

### Core Question

Can a society survive if people see themselves only as individuals and not as members of a shared project?

### Transcript

Modern politics often focuses on rights while neglecting belonging.

Neutrality about values sounds appealing, but it creates a vacuum. People want recognition, not just rights.

When public life avoids moral language, it leaves space for resentment-driven identities to take over.

### The Common Good

A politics of the common good asks difficult questions:

- What obligations do we have to future generations?  
- What kinds of work deserve honor?  
- What sacrifices should be shared?

Avoiding these questions does not make a society neutral. It makes it hollow.

## Module 10 — Moral Reasoning in an Age of Technology

### Core Question

As machines make decisions, who is morally responsible?

### Transcript

Algorithms rank, recommend, hire, and exclude. We often tell ourselves, “the system decided.”

But systems are designed. Values are encoded. Trade-offs are chosen.

Technology does not remove moral responsibility. It obscures it.

### Closing Reflection

The future will not be saved by smarter machines alone.

It will require citizens capable of moral judgment and public debate about values.

The most important skill of the 21st century is not coding. It is moral reasoning.
