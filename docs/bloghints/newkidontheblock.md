    1. I knew about Gaussian distribution but reading about Tracy-Widom is something new. Explain the diff and with illustration
    2. Our Second year UCF girl presented her Research paper at AGU2025- Americal Geophusical union at New orleans, Luisiana on Dec 15. She spoke in a nice, calm demeanor and my huge appreciation for her. I could sense her anger that the great country's administation is cuttif off funding to Research Labs and this is very unfortunate. I do believe the University environment is best suited for innovative, ground breaking research and open sourcing it for the benefit of overall humanity than the R&D department of massive corporate companies. Been egging her to visit our Pichavaram to see our mangroves. These 2 born few months apart to twins born few minutes apart - studious in their studies and now embarking in to their careers is a good watch for me. They seem well grounded and I wish them well and achieve whatever set out to do.
    3. I have configured Guardian Science Weekly as part of my 'Good morning' routine in Smart Speaker and found yesterday's topic- “What’s worse for us, sugar or sweeteners?” pretty interesting. Core question:
Should we swap sugar for artificial sweeteners to be healthier? Or are sweeteners equally (or more) problematic? 
The Guardian

Main takeaways:

Both sugar and artificial sweeteners have health downsides, but the science doesn’t give a simple “pick one” answer. 
The Guardian

Eating too much sugar is clearly linked to obesity, diabetes and other metabolic issues.

Artificial sweeteners seem safer in that they don’t contribute calories directly—but evidence is mixed and complex.

Experts on the show (from Anglia Ruskin University & University of Washington’s public health school) explain that while sweeteners might reduce energy intake, they don’t automatically lead to better health outcomes.

Some research suggests artificial sweeteners can have unexpected effects — including on hunger cues, gut microbiota, or long-term metabolic health (though findings aren’t definitive).

The bottom line from the conversation: neither sugar nor sweeteners are “health foods.” Moderation and context matter. 
Apple Podcasts

If you want a pretty straight, evidence-based takeaway: cut back on added sugar; don’t assume sweeteners are a free pass to health — they’re just a different risk profile, not a safe “healthy” alternative.
    4. I know many of you took that NASSCOM quiz and one of our boy scoread centum and ofcourse it is expected - 20 year odd experience in the software field. But the funny thing is it asked him to 'Retake the quiz'! I am sure no human/teacher will ask a student who scored centum to retake the test. Folks need to write software better or in these days prompt better
    5. As 2025 winds down, I from whatever little knowledge on the subject -could infer that the text/ language part is sorted out and the world models will start to take things at such high velocity in 2026 and 2027 that AGI will get done. So all of you who are employed now need to think through what to do if no work - depend on government doleout as UBI - Universal Basic Income! for sustenance. But make no  mistake this will be achieved and it will be a different world altogether. That's my 2 cents.
     6. I am very surprised that Englishmen are letting Australia roughshod all over them. There is no contest at all in this Ashes series. Now porbably only south africa can stand up to them in test series.
     7. I haven't read any books recenly as still immersed in listening to Dan Brown's Secret of Secrets and reaching the climax state now engrossed so much that felt bone chilling fear then gollam machets Michael. This is my first experience of listening to a fiction novel of 700 odd pages and pretty intrigued how he connects with modern day tech- AI with Conscience - where is it- local or remote,materialism vs neotism( such a new word/concept it seems, that i am getting auto corrected to Nepotism!)  nueral networks, synapses etc.. 

     Let me windoff wishing you all Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays
