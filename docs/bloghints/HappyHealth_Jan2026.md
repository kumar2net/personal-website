On to our first edition of 2026: The Ayurveda Issue. To understand Ayurveda, we must understand that our bodies operate on multiple clocks. There is the circadian rhythm that governs sleep and waking. There is the seasonal shift in metabolism that makes you crave heavier foods in winter. There is the decades-long arc of changing nutritional needs as you age.

Ayurveda has long organised health around these temporal patterns. Childhood is the Kapha phase, focused on building physical structure. Adulthood becomes the Pitta years, managing metabolic intensity and ambition. After 50, the Vata stage requires gentler routines and lighter foods. Seasonal eating follows similar logic: bitter greens in spring, cooling cucumbers in summer, warming soups in monsoon.

Sometimes traditional advice survives not because it is sacred, but because it is correct. The question is which of these traditional frameworks still apply.

This issue examines Ayurvedic principles through the lens of current evidence—what works, what needs updating, and what artificial intelligence is revealing about ancient diagnostic methods.

The Ayurveda special package was anchored by our in-house expert, assistant editor Dr Vishnupriya Warrier (MD in Ayurveda), and curated by senior editor Sudhakar Jha. The package features contributions from writers Varun Ramesh Balan, Dr Ananya Krishnan, Pallavi Dubey, Dr S Saberitha, and Deepika J.

In this issue, we cover:

• Living rhythmic at every stage: Ayurveda divides life into three doshic phases—Kapha for childhood growth, Pitta for adult ambition, Vata for elder fragility. Each stage demands different nutritional and lifestyle approaches. Modern paediatric research increasingly validates what the ancient texts observed: what builds a child's body can overwhelm an aging digestive system decades later.

• In sync with nature: Ritucharya maps dietary needs across six seasonal cycles, from spring's need for bitter greens to winter's tolerance for richer foods. The underlying principle is adaptation: your physiology shifts with external conditions, and nutrition must follow. Summer heat that would normally aggravate inflammation becomes manageable with hydrating foods like cucumber and melon.

• Deep Ayurveda: Artificial intelligence is translating Vata, Pitta, and Kapha into measurable genetic markers and inflammatory biomarkers. Natural language processing digitises classical Sanskrit texts, connecting ancient vocabulary to modern lab values. The technology could democratise assessments that have always required years of training in pulse diagnosis.

• Herbal oral care: Laboratory studies confirm that neem, miswak, and babool reduce plaque and gum disease. Dosha-based oral care offers practical customisation: sesame oil for dry mouths, neem for inflamed gums, ginger for plaque prevention. The caveat: check the Relative Dentin Abrasivity score to avoid eroding enamel whilst you clean.

• Your blueprint for wellness: Dr MS Mahadevan, medical director, Happiest Ayurveda, explains why daily routines prevent disease more effectively than emergency medicine cures it. His central argument: weak digestive fire is the root of chronic illness because undigested food ferments, producing metabolic waste that triggers systemic inflammation.

• Mindful eating rituals: Food influences mental state as much as physical health through three categories—Sattvic for clarity, Rajasic for restlessness, Tamasic for lethargy. One practical rule stands out: fill only three-quarters of your stomach during meals, leaving space for digestive enzymes to work properly.

Also in this issue:

• A plasma bolt for healing: Cold Atmospheric Plasma breaches bacterial biofilms that block antibiotics from reaching chronic wounds. It is the fourth state of matter being used to make slimy bacterial fortresses permeable.

• Pioneering telesurgery: India achieved the world's first intercontinental robotic cardiac surgery in 2025\. A surgeon in France operated on a patient in India with 30-millisecond latency.

• Movement as pain relief: Controlled strength training treats chronic pain more safely than opioids or surgery. A 63-year-old woman with a slipped disc learnt to deadlift 75kg.

• The gut-sleep connection: Sleep deprivation reduces beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus, creating "leaky gut" and systemic inflammation. Poor sleep damages the microbiome, and an imbalanced microbiome fragments sleep.

• Debunking wellness fads: Coffee enemas have caused rectal burns, severe dehydration, and death. Young men self-prescribing shilajit and ashwagandha without supervision risk liver and kidney damage.

Key takeaways for integrating Ayurvedic principles:

• Eat according to digestive capacity: Wait for clear hunger signals before eating, not habitual mealtimes. Eating when digestion is weak produces unmetabolised waste that triggers inflammation.

• Adjust diet to season and life stage: Children need building blocks; adults need metabolic balance; older adults need gentler foods. Spring demands lighter fare; winter tolerates richer meals.

• Protect digestion during meals: Eat without screens. Chew thoroughly. Avoid ice-cold drinks with food. Fill only three-quarters of the stomach.

• Validate traditional practices with modern safety standards: Herbal ingredients work, but check abrasivity scores to prevent enamel damage. Use supplements under medical supervision. Natural does not mean harmless.
