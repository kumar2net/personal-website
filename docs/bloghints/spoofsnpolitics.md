    5. The best part of  the book to me is this - All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship Problems

The Courage to Be Disliked distills Adlerian psychology into one unsettling sentence: “All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.” The claim is not that pain, failure, or hardship do not exist—but that they become problems only when measured against others. Anxiety arises from how we are seen, anger from attempts to control or assert power, inferiority from comparison, and fear from the possible loss of belonging. Strip away the audience, the hierarchy, the expectation of approval, and much of our distress dissolves. This perspective shifts the focus from fixing circumstances to examining relationships—especially our dependency on recognition. Freedom, Adler argues, begins the moment we accept the risk of being disliked and choose to live by our own values rather than by borrowed judgments.        
    6. One think I like about our youngsters is they try varierty stuff - food
       included. During my travels I used to see Sushi and would check the menu
       card will find its mostly or always seafood. But now I hear you get Vegan
       Sushi too as RJ were telling me. But I used to wonder how these Japanese
       folks stuff the Sushi with chopsticks in one go! I used to struggle when
       our roadside Panipuri wallah's have those big size ones and  with aloo,
       chana, onion and jeera watere  all the
       stuffing and I end up spilling all over. When you have humans making
       these they will probably will have different sizes so you can ask to give
       small or medium sizes ones - but these days i think these are machine
       made and all his 1000 odd puri's will be same size and bulk

    10. India Beverage market article on non-alhocolic ones caught my attention - The Regional Chessboard: Why India Isn’t One Market?  
India’s beverage industry isn’t a single battlefield—it’s a thousand skirmishes. While national giants dominate headlines, local champions often rule their home turf.  

Take Gujarat: Here, Wagh Bakri tea commands a staggering 55–60% market share^, outmuscling Hindustan Unilever Limited and Tata Tea. In Tamil Nadu, filter coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s a cultural ritual. North India swears by lassi and buttermilk during summer, while Maharashtra’s urban youth are driving RTD coffee growth.  

For brands, this means one-size-fits-all strategies fail. Winning India’s “Share of Throat” requires mastering regional taste maps as much as national trends.
