blog post tile: is TOS reall a thing?
1. Term of Service is a joke on us uses of prodcut and digital services and who
   reads those multi page mico font conditons of use. So to me any technology
   will be used by good and more so and well so by bad actors. One thing is
   clear - we will destroy ourself much faster with all this tech tools. There
   is a saying 'elect a clown and be ready of a circus'
2. He hasn't changed a bit, still buys lot of physical books - old school type.

4. The Case for Dystopian AI
From Citrini to jobs exposed to AI. What if the promise of AI turns into something destabilizing and profoundly unfair. Are we missing some of the biggest risks of AI getting too close to home?

Citrini Research - Is AI becoming the snake that bites its own tail?
As many of you know, I’m fairly concerned Generative AI is accelerating wealth inequality. But how would that take place in a deteriorating labor market? What if we are witnessing history, but not the uplifting kind. 😕

At the same time, older workers similarly don’t have the “adaptive capacity” to switch into new roles Older workers are less likely to retrain, relocate, or switch occupations compared to their younger counterparts, and a range of studies has found that job loss for older workers leads to greater earnings losses and lower reemployment rates. Studies show that workers aged 55-64 who experienced job loss during the Great Recession were about 16 percentage points less likely than those aged 35-44 to find employment afterward. Nevertheless, there’s a paradoxical trend occurring for older workers: they are actually seeing an uptick in hiring. Studies have found that while AI is heavily impacting entry-level roles (with employment for 22- to 25-year-olds in exposed jobs dropping 6% between late 2022 and late 2025), employment for older, more experienced workers in the same sectors actually grew.

“This may be one of the first tech revolutions that may favor older workers,” said Matt Sigelman, president of the BurningGlass Institute, a workforce think tank. “Past tech revolutions have tended to bypass older workers because they haven’t necessarily built those tech skills. But we’re finding that AI is advantaging those who have expertise.”

Low-wage workers Can’t Endure The Downturn
It’s hard to underestimate just how painful this tech revolution is going to be for so many low-wage workers. Even if AI is going to bring so many more new jobs to the market than it destroys (which is generally the consensus) the short-term pains cannot be denied. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will suffer in the short-term which will create long-term disadvantages for their children. Displacement decreases permanent employment probability by 19% within a year and 12% after five years for low-income workers, but the same is not true for high-income workers who can move to new places, have better resourced social networks, and can invest in new skill training or the support of placement agencies.

Coase theorem for the first time. With the kind of huge number  of piled up cases
in indian courts - may be an agreed amount x is if the disputed amount is less
than this Coase is applied by default. ofcourse this can be only be for
non-cirominal cases
Brian Groh was one of these low-wage workers who was starting to lose his freelance writing work to AI. Gigs were disappearing and his already meager income was drying up with it. Brian left DC to move back to Ohio to both be near family and reduce his everyday costs. But even that was not enough. One day when Brian was feeling particularly low about his wage prospects, he asked the same chatbot that was taking away his livelihood what he should do about his job prospects? The chatbot told him to buy a chainsaw and start doing wood work. “On good days, I earned more doing tree work than I ever had writing copy,” Brian said. But eventually the pain from the physically demanding work became hard for Brian and he injured his back. When a neighbor offered him prescription painkillers to keep working despite the pain, Brian froze as he saw the path he might be heading down in this Ohio town that had claimed so many lives. Although he knew that AI probably couldn’t chop down trees the way he could, fears about the future remained.

Workers with easily replaceable skills struggle to re-enter the AI-infused workplace

Secretaries, cashiers, front desk attendants, tax accountants, and customer service reps are among the first in line to lose their jobs to AI. 6.1 million workers fall into this category of low-skilled work (the bottom right corner of the chart above) where people are often executing easily repeatable tasks that new technology is seeking to replace. Many of these workers as well have few other skill
