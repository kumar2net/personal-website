blog post title: Dilbert and other topics
1. I got a bit emotional reading Scott Adam's farewell letter and pained by the
   health issues he faced. I used to like the Dilbert comics which typically
    appeared in finance newspaper he in india. I normally only buy the normal newspaper and not the financial ones so typically read at office reception desk where they kept a copy. The pointy hair boss and his takes
   on corporate slop used to always bring a smile as I can relate to lots of
   those. RIP Scott. Even if i learn to wrote 10 percent as good as you its a
   huge achievement. i captured some of his tips in previous post. Give it a
   read if you would like.
2. One of my fellow table tennis player which whom I used to play with in YMCA  lived in the same flat in Kodambakkam as
   Onepot - OPOS Ramakrishnan and i remembered this when i heard our Birminham boy is
   trying this out to ease his daily cooking chore. My TT co-player as living
   single and used one pot and he was so impressed with the technique that as a
   token of gratitude - makes a cup of filter  coffee every morning at 5 am and
   leave the flask at Ranga's doorstep.The One Pot One Shot (OPOS) cooking style is a patented technique owned by Ramakrishnan, who is the administrator of the Facebook group 'United by Food'. OPOS is also a copyrighted term. 

Spearheaded by the rebellious cook who dares to defy every single rulebook there is in the culinary world, OPOS, as the name suggests, uses one pot (a 2 ltr pressure cooker generally), aligns the ingredients in a specific way, uses standardised equipment and sticks to standardises recipe cards so that the results don’t vary significantly.
3. In India More than 40 million young people are in higher education, and over 10 million are entering the labour market every year as per latest data points. It is crucial that we equip them with the skills, confidence, and networks they need to thrive.
4. In this perspective my interaction with a 6th standard girl student was very interesting and engaging and made me forgot all the pain i am going through. The teacher has created a whatsapp group with parent's mobile numberes and sends the home work to be done and submitted next day by evening. Then the girl await her dad's return from work to read the message and start working on it. On learning that she is a very bright student, I factory reset my Lenovo laptop which is been lying around unused for few months and spent 20 min with her and her electrician/plumber dad and explained few basic stuff and set her off. The glint in her eyes made my day. She said he likes maths and favourite of her teacher. Watching the tender fingers swiping the track pad made me smile. She was just using 1 finger being used to do that in her dad's mobile i think and i just said use 2 fingers. if somework needs to be submitted - project etc..then she whatsapp the scanned stuff she wrote to the nearby xerox/print shop and got it printed
5. The daily sheet calendar and the amount of data they pack on it used to
   impress me in those good old days. Typically it got gifted by the local
   merchant and i dont think they do this in this day and time

6. One of our fam girls said she now goes to 'Lagree' classes instead of
   Pilates. I hear this for the first time. We had the chuckle when the LLM
   fellow said – the muscles you never know existed will send you an invoice'

8. I have been struggling with some Gen Alpha lingo for a while and got tutored
   by this lovely boy:

9. This statement which i read conveys it perfectly – universities are about to realize that they had been selling the wrong product for the 150 years. they thought they sold knowledge, then information became free. they pivoted to selling credentials but now credentials are just proxies. in the post-ai era the universities who survive will realize they were always selling 3 things: network, status signaling, and a 4 years of protected time to become an adult.
