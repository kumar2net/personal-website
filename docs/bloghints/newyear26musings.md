   community college. I became involved with the developmental mathematics in
   2006 and was appalled to learn that a student without strong mathematical

   Trying to understand what's meant by heavy crude and what it takes to convert
   this to refinery grade. 330 billion barrels! thats the macro data at play and
   we know he who controls fossil fuels gets to play the global policeman role.
   All the renewables are not cutting it and AI is guzzling giga-watts
4. I was pretty intrigued that the politicians stock investments data need to be
   disclosed in public in the great country -  कश हमारे इंडिया में भी इसे होता तो अच्छा रहता 
5. The gig worker strike- food and groceries 10 minute delivery and back and forth tirade is quite gripping - Champagne Sociliast - tag conferred on the politician is quite funny
6. Ginger bread decoration for Christmas is a new learning to me that an edible
   stuff is used for this. Dont ants flock to them in western countries?
7. We are a 'uyi amma' nation. So to watch our girl in her bharathnatyam dancer
   avatar stomp her feet on 'Nataraja Day' Thiruvathirai is complelling to
