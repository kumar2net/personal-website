No, I am not going to talk about some Melon who will be getting a Trillion Dollar pay package as I don't know how many Zeroes are in that!
I am happy to hear from our Microbiology expert that he is using AI based test automation and data analysis in R for his clinical trial related work. And our Environmental Sciences PG girl uses MATLAB for her Research work and she comes up with beautiful charts for her papers. 
Rare earth minerals - hot topic these days.  tried to find out what these Rare Earth mineral names are:
Which minerals / rare earths
When people say “rare earths”, they generally refer to the 17 lanthanide-series elements (plus sometimes yttrium & scandium) that have special magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties. Axios+1
 Here are the highlights (for your tech-stack / blogging lens):
Light Rare Earth Elements (LREEs): e.g., neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La). These are used for strong permanent magnets (Nd/Pr) and catalysts among other things.


Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs): e.g., dysprosium (Dy), terbium (Tb), lutetium (Lu), yttrium (Y) & some others. These often enhance magnet performance at high temperature (important for EV motors, wind turbines, defence). DIGITIMES Asia+1


Other critical minerals often mentioned alongside: lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel, silicon, etc. China has strong positions in many of these processing value-chains. Cipher News+1


Use-cases (where they’re used)
This directly ties into your interest in clean tech / AI / devices.
Permanent magnets (especially NdFeB magnets) are used in: electric vehicle (EV) motors, hybrid vehicles, wind-turbine generators, computer hard drives, robotics, drones, sensors.


HREEs like dysprosium/terbium: used for high-temperature magnets (e.g., aerospace, high performance EV/HEV motors).


Consumer electronics: smartphones, laptops, displays, LED lighting, camera sensors — rare earths serve for luminescent phosphors, batteries, capacitors.


Defence/advanced tech: radar systems, guided missiles, stealth materials, satellites. Because rare earths often have very specific magnetic/optical/thermal properties essential for high-end systems.


Clean energy transition: Because to build wind turbines, EVs, energy storage, you need high-performance motors and magnets — rare earths are key. For example, one offshore wind turbine can require ~4 tons of magnets containing rare earths according to an IEA quote. Cipher News


So in short: From your stack-perspective (AI, networks, wireless, devices) many layers depend on these minerals for hardware.

🧠 AI, Health & Hustle: What Young Indians Should Really Know

Ask AI, but Trust Your Doctor

Happiest Health-November25

AI can now scan X-rays, spot diabetes in eyes, and even detect early cancers. But the editorial callout of the month is clear — “Use AI like a map, not a manual.” Generative tools write well but can hallucinate. Ask them for context, never for a prescription. Your doctor’s judgment — not a chatbot’s confidence — still saves lives.

India’s Digital Health Leap

Happiest Health-November25

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to give every citizen a digital health ID so that lab results, prescriptions, and scans follow you securely wherever you go. Think of it as the UPI moment for healthcare. AI tools like Qure’s qXR are already finding 15–20 % more TB cases by reading chest X-rays faster. Still, young professionals must demand data privacy and transparency before trusting any health app with their information.

AI on the Mind

Happiest Health-November25

Chatbots are becoming emotional companions for Gen Z and millennials. They help us vent — but psychologists warn against over-reliance. Digital empathy has limits: the bot won’t catch the tremor in your voice or the tear you blink away. Healthy rule: if your “AI friend” knows more about your feelings than your closest human friend, pause and re-connect offline.

Timely Boosters & Everyday Immunity

Happiest Health-November25

Post-COVID, India’s kids and young adults face what doctors call an “immunity gap.” Routine vaccines — flu, typhoid (TCV), and HPV for girls and boys — are back in focus. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics now recommends pairing flu boosters with regular measles-rubella shots and catch-up doses for missed years. Bottom line: prevention is cheaper than any AI-driven cure.

Strength Starts with Legs

Happiest Health-November25

Forget fancy gyms — five exercises matter most: squats, lunges, wall sits, calf raises and single-leg stands. They build balance and bone density for your desk-to-commute lifestyle. “The idea is to prepare, not repair,” as coach Ramji Srinivasan says. Ten minutes a day beats a two-hour Sunday guilt session.

Food Fix for the Busy Body

Happiest Health-November25

ICMR’s latest data shows young Indians get 62 % of calories from carbs and only 12 % from protein. That’s a fast track to low energy and high sugar levels. Simple swaps work wonders: • Add dal and eggs before adding supplements. • Choose ragi or brown rice a few times a week. • Skip hidden sugars in granola and “healthy” drinks.

Reset Habits that Age You Early

Happiest Health-November25

Dermatologists say old T-shirts harbour bacteria and friction spots that age the skin faster. If you haven’t changed your gym tee in a year — that’s not nostalgia; it’s a dermatitis trap. Replace, rewash, renew — same rule for your habits.

🩵 Takeaway

Gen Z and millennial India live at the intersection of tech and health. AI will guide you, but discipline will heal you. Eat real food, move daily, sleep deep, and verify your AI answers with a human. That’s the real upgrade.

They tell me to share with family and friends. Please give it a read in laptop for better experience. Be ‘H-ppy’ - thats the clue- the dash is actually the symbol you get when you press Shift 2. Do whatsapp me if you didn’t get the clue.
