# Writing Skill

Goal: write clear, direct blog posts with one sharp point.

Rules:
1. Start with a hook in the first sentence. If it does not pull, rewrite.
2. Keep sentences short. Aim for one thought per sentence.
3. Use active voice and precise verbs. Prefer concrete nouns.
4. Cut filler. Remove "very", "really", "just", "that" when possible.
5. Favor simple words over fancy words.
6. Keep one main point. Everything supports it.
7. Avoid cliches and corporate language.
8. End without a summary. Last line should surprise but feel right.
9. Read aloud pass: ensure rhythm and clarity.
