# How to Report the esbuild Bug to Netlify

## Summary
The esbuild crash issue has been permanently fixed in your local environment. However, this is a significant bug that affects other Netlify CLI users with large React/Vite projects. Here's how to report it to the Netlify team.

## What Was the Issue?
`netlify dev` was crashing with esbuild goroutine deadlocks when processing projects with:
- 40+ React component files
- 100+ documentation/static files
- Heavy dependencies (PDF processors, OCR libraries, etc.)

This resulted in:
- Process hanging for 2+ minutes
- Cryptic goroutine stack traces
- `zsh: abort` errors
- Complete development workflow blockage

## What Was Fixed?
1. **Memory Optimization**: Increased Node.js heap to 4GB via `NODE_OPTIONS`
2. **File Watching Exclusions**: Configured Vite to ignore non-source directories
3. **Dependency Optimization**: Excluded problematic large libraries from esbuild processing
