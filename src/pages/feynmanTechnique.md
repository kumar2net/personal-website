# Feynman Techniques: Learning Like Richard Feynman

Lately, I’ve been reading about Richard Feynman on my Kindle Oasis, inspired by his stories and his refreshingly simple way of learning. The **Feynman Technique**—explaining any idea in plain language—is still my favorite tool for understanding anything, whether it’s physics or everyday puzzles.

## The Heart of Feynman’s Method

Feynman believed: *If you can’t explain it to a child, you don’t really understand it.* Each time you try, you uncover gaps fast—and that’s how you actually learn.

## Childhood Curiosity: Patterns, Questions, and 2x+7=15

- Feynman’s dad taught him by stacking tiles and spotting patterns, making discovery fun and hands-on.
- As a child, Feynman also found and studied his aunt’s old algebra book in the attic, learning to solve for unknowns—not just by memorizing school “rules,” but by following the logic itself[2][5].
- One vivid story: He saw his cousin struggling with \(2x + 7 = 15\) and simply knew the answer was 4—but his cousin insisted he had to solve it “by algebra,” not “by arithmetic.” Feynman was puzzled by the idea that there’s only one “right” way to find the answer, since for him, solving for the unknown was the whole point—not the method
- This experience stuck with him: he realized that blindly following steps without understanding leads to confusion, not real learning[5][9]. For Feynman, algebra was about curiosity and logic, not just memorizing procedures.

## Early Library Adventures

When Feynman was still very young, he went to the library and took out *Calculus for the Practical Man*—pretending it was for his dad, but really, he was just that curious!

## A Note About Space-Time

Feynman often emphasized that space and time are woven together into what we now call "space-time." He explained that every event in the universe has both a location and a moment—and the two can't be separated if you want to understand how the universe really works.

## The Feynman Technique at a Glance

1. **Pick a concept** you want to learn.
2. **Explain it simply**—pretend you’re teaching a six-year-old.
3. **Notice where you hesitate;** revisit those points.
4. **Repeat until your explanation is smooth and simple.**

## Why It Resonates

For Feynman, the joy was never in titles or awards—though he won a Nobel Prize for revolutionizing quantum electrodynamics, he always said the real prize was the thrill of discovery and sharing what he learned. Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or just curious, his technique proves that true understanding is about breaking things down and plenty of honest, playful curiosity.

## The Oppenheimer Chapter: One Part of a Bigger Life

It’s worth remembering: Feynman worked alongside Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project, making the first nuclear bomb. But he soon moved on—choosing a life defined by teaching, learning, and making science joyful, not just historical.
