# Ekadasi morphs into IF and now Autophagy!

It’s amusing how fasting—popularized first as Ekadasi in our cultural traditions, then as “intermittent fasting” (IF) in the wellness world—is now the subject of scientific fascination for its role in autophagy, our cells’ natural cleanup system. Honestly, I think our ancestors just *knew*—they practiced fasting for clarity, discipline, and well-being, long before anyone measured blood glucose or published a paper on metabolic switches.

## The Wisdom Before Words: From Ekadasi to IF

In Indian culture, fasting—especially on Ekadasi—wasn’t just about abstaining from food. It was a rhythm, a discipline, a reset. There was no talk of “autophagy,” no biomarkers, just generations of people trusting that pausing food was somehow good for their bodies and minds. Now, science is putting numbers and names to what tradition has always felt: regular fasting is foundational for cellular repair, metabolic health, and resilience.

## The 13-Hour Fast: A Practical, Modern Option

A 13-hour fasting window—say, from 7 PM to 11 AM—is a simple, sustainable way to dip into the benefits. This is “time-restricted eating” (TRE) in its gentlest, most doable form. Here’s what it offers:

- **Metabolic Reset:** Improves insulin sensitivity, nudges your body to use stored fat, and helps regulate blood sugar.
- **Cellular Cleanup (Autophagy):** After 10–12 hours without food, your cells start recycling damaged parts, supporting overall health.
- **Better Sleep & Energy:** Eating early supports restful sleep, and stable energy in the morning follows.

## Ekadasi, IF, and Cellular Health: The Table

| Practice             | Frequency         | Key Effects                                     | Autophagy Action     |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Ekadasi Fasting      | Twice a month    | Deep spiritual/mental reset, discipline, cellular repair | Strong               |
| 13-hour IF           | Daily/Regular    | Gentle metabolic tune-up, energy, sustainable habit      | Moderate             |
| Classic IF (16:8)    | Daily/Weekly     | Weight management, deeper cellular cleanup              | Well-documented      |

## The Real Curious Case: What About Diabetes and Medications?

Since i am taking diabetic medications, I am carefully trying to use this technique and tweaking it to my way of life.





## Takeaway

Fasting—whether you call it Ekadasi, intermittent, or just a mindful pause between dinner and brunch—shows that cultural tradition and science are both pointing toward the same truth: periodic rest from food is renewing. I’m genuinely exploring how to blend both worlds—embracing ancient rhythms while respecting modern medicine—so I can find a practice that’s safe, sustainable, and supportive for both mind and body. Sometimes, the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and trust what’s always worked—with a little help from science and some sensible precautions.
