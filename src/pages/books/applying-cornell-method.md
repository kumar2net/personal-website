Cornell Method – Studying with Notes

Highlight (yellow) - Page 6

It is actually a strategy that systematizes note-taking, transforming the way we organize thoughts and information presented to us. The first step to fully benefit from this technique is the structured organization of information. By dividing the page into distinct sections for main notes, details, and summaries, we create a robust and replicable model that not only reflects the studied content but also facilitates its understanding and retention. In this book, we will explore all dimensions of the Cornell Method, from its origins to its practical application, understanding how to build these notes.

Structure defined by Walter Pauk of the Cornell Method

brilliant concept

The inspiration for this structure came from Professor Pauk's observation of how the human brain processes and retains information. He recognized the importance of actively synthesizing knowledge and connecting the pieces of the puzzle, rather than simply accumulating isolated facts. Thus, this note-taking system was designed not just as a technique for taking notes but as a method that promotes deep understanding and memorization of concepts.

How Does the Cornell Method Work?

Highlight (yellow) - Page 23

The first step in using the technique is structuring the notes. By dividing the page into three distinct sections, we create an organized environment that reflects the structure of the knowledge itself. The original structure includes a narrow column on the left reserved for key questions, a column on the right for notes, and a space at the bottom for a summary. According to Pauk’s instructions, filling out these pages should begin with noting ideas and concepts during the class or lecture. Hours later, you should review these notes and enhance the information by filling in gaps. This will allow you to identify the main ideas (which we will call key concepts) and then fill in the left column by developing questions related to these identified ideas.

Detailing the Structure A building can only stand because of its structure, right? The same thought can be applied to our notes. For this, it is essential to follow a model or format that organizes and supports the information efficiently. This structure can be applied to both physical and digital organization systems, something we will explore in more detail later. The top part of the note will be dedicated to the descriptive information of the material we are studying. In this section, details such as the title, category, date, speaker's name, professor's name, subject, topic, and other relevant information will be placed for organization and quick retrieval of these notes. The narrow column on the left will be reserved for keywords and main topics. This section will be used to develop questions and keywords based on the main ideas and information we record in the notes. The wider column on the right is intended for detailed notes. Here, you can expand your ideas, write examples, and capture important nuances — you can even draw illustrations if you like. This section serves as a repository for more extensive information, ensuring that critical details are recorded; we will call these key concepts. Finally, the bottom space of the page is reserved for a concise summary, a distillation of the main points and essential concepts. This summary not only facilitates quick review but also strengthens retention by challenging us to express the information clearly and succinctly in our own words.

The first guideline for identifying key concepts is to adopt a selective mindset.

Cornell Notes Combined with the Feynman Technique

Highlight (yellow) - Page 60

Among these valuable approaches that aid in study routines, the Cornell Method and the Feynman Technique stand out as powerful tools for enhancing learning and information retention. So why not use both to achieve better results? The Feynman Technique, named after the renowned physicist Richard Feynman, encourages the simplification of complex concepts by explaining them as if teaching someone else. The essence is to clarify understanding and identify gaps in knowledge.

haha yes. Combine with Feymann's
