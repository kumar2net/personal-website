          <p className="mb-4">
            Sunday morning, I went outside to get some sunlight into my body because I had been down with a high fever the previous night.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            As I stepped into the fresh air, I noticed a darkling beetle (<span className="text-red-600 font-semibold">கருப்பு வண்டு</span>), just turning in an inverted position and kicking its legs, trying to very hard to get in its feet. Something moved me to help. I took a piece of stick and gently helped it into its normal position. I felt so happy, and it started to walk from the spot very gingerly. It looked like a bloated, mature beetle—one that had lived through several months/ years of our Vadavalli seasons, its dark brown shell weathered by time and the tropical climate of Coimbatore. These typically feed on dead and decaying plant material, fallen leaves and organic debris, fungus and mold especially of coconut trees.

          <p className="mb-4">
            It walked around a bit, testing its restored mobility. Then I went to the gate, got the milk packets, and kept them in the fridge. When I came back and looked at it, it was literally struggling to walk and only had a few steps left in it as it was literally on its last legs. So I gave it a little bit of water from the bottle wife uses to feed the cactus and tulsi plant in the verandah. It drank the water and then it seemed like it was gone as it became completely motionless. I thought it was dead, and gone.

        <section id="chapter2" className="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">CHAPTER TWO: THE LAST BREATH</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I couldn't control my feelings and I started crying uncontrollably having just watched the beetle die in front of me. I thought, well, what I gave was the last gasp, the last drop of water that it was longing for, and it breathed its last in front of me.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            It upset me deeply. I went inside and then came back after some time, and I noticed it had started to move a bit, so I gave it a little bit more water and it sipped that water - i could hear that minute slurping sound. It extended its tentacles and sipped the all water it could, and then it felt better i think. It is still alive, and it made me so happy and made me really think.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">CHAPTER THREE: REFLECTIONS ON LIFE AND DEATH</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It was a very profound experience for me. Here was this darkling beetle, a creature that typically lives for several months in our Vadavalli climate, reaching the end of its natural lifespan. Will I have enough goodwill in the room I leave behind? Will someone I love, a family member or a friend or whoever it is—give me the last sip or last gulp of that water and then I exit the world, the exit button as they call it?
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            I'm not afraid because after all this reading of philosophical books, I have learned there's no pain in Death, right? I didn't know when I was born, and not going to know when I am going to be dead. So there's no pain. But in between this time span is what is all that I go through - is all my health issues, sufferings, pains due to what? I think I just have to face the music and can't question anything, NO WAY OUT! Wish that THIS TOO SHALL PASS Mind you at this time I didnt even have an inkling of loads of sufferings and further loss of part part - what is going to unfold in the next 20 days
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is a reflection of a true story, and I just want to share it. Something in me teels me that beetle was my thatha (granddad) who came to check on me that early morning, that day

            These beetles play a crucial role in Vadavalli's ecosystem by breaking down organic matter and enriching the soil, supporting the growth of coconut trees, mango trees, and other vegetation common in our region.
