# Atheism: A Wonderful World Without Religion

*By Tom Miles*

## Introduction

Throughout human history religions have been a staggeringly powerful force in the hearts and minds of their adherents and in society as a whole. It has moved men and women to inspiring acts of bravery and spurred the creation of some of the most sublime works of art, and arguably has been pivotal in the creation of stable societies and the social order we see today. At the same time, though, it has also been responsible for some of the most heinous atrocities ever committed.

## The Nature of Religious Belief

Through revelation is the greater part of belief conceived, though it is also believed that all human beings are capable of experiencing the supernatural – all it takes is to "open one's mind" to it. As soon as the beliefs world religions have held for thousands of years come under scrutiny, though, they begin to show their imperfections.

Everything that happened was in some way caused by, or a manifestation of their will – they became what we today call gods.

## Memory and Reality

When we recall something, we are not actually recalling the event itself but the last time we recalled the event.

## Science and Religion

To date, not a single claim of faith healing, paranormal activity, or even many of the historical claims made by world religions have been stood the test of this undeniably powerful and useful system. Even though science has refuted many of the claims of religion, many still cling to belief in God by arguing that there is still so much we do not know at the periphery of human knowledge.

But holding out on belief based on what we do not know is an uneasy position. As the known continues to encroach into the unknown, it is inevitably not God that we find.

## Morality and Evolution

Morality has a simple Darwinian imperative behind it: a species of animals that help each other and treat each other better are more likely to survive, due to the simple fact that they can better weather the difficulties of survival by forming co-operative societies.

## Death and Meaning

The first approach to dealing with death is purely pragmatic – death is inevitable, and we have no indication that there is something beyond it, so it is pointless to try to make something up. The reason we can know that death is not something to be greatly feared is that we have all experienced it before.

As the Greek philosopher Epicurus said: "Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain. The fear of death arises from the belief that in death, there is awareness."

## Human Connection

"A stranger is just a friend you haven't met" – the saying seems platitudinous and cliché, but it is said so much for a reason. One of the greatest delights is to get to know another person so completely as to become inextricably linked in their life's story.

## The Beauty of Science

There is no fable or myth put forward by any religion more beautiful and transcendent than that fact: we are literally made of stardust.

## The Future of Atheism

It is the dream of every atheist to reach a stage in society never to have to call themselves such, for it to simply be taken for granted that there is no need for a god hypothesis. Religion has shown itself time and again to be a severely limiting force in both the lives of individuals and in society as a whole.

Barring the communist oddity that is China, the societies with the highest non-religious populations tend to be those with the highest standard of living and median income, while those with the lowest are the most religious. It is not entirely clear whether lower levels of religiosity create a higher quality of life or if it's the other way around, but the simple fact that they correlate makes lowering the prevalence of religious faith a worthwhile undertaking.

There is so much more to life than blindly following the dictates of the past. The profusion of awe and beauty that awaits us when we finally shrug it off is well worth the loss of any benefits faith ever pretended to offer us. And so, while there is still religion there will always be atheists, people who actively work to expose the intellectual and moral paucity of this force that belongs firmly in the infancy of our species.
