He also told me they could try to save my left eye, but after a few failed surgeries my vision in that eye was gone. If you decide to have kids, they may also have it."

Anyone can learn about and develop an outward focus, starting early on in life. But, fair warning: you must put your mortality in clear view first. Acknowledging that all our stories have an end can be deeply beneficial. In my own experience, orienting my efforts to where I could make the greatest contributions, both during and beyond my lifetime, helped me to push through major challenges and made life far more meaningful."
