I like to think of it as an audience in your head that is analyzing the things you do and say. If you don't get control of it, it can take over like a class full of rowdy kids. When it comes up and says, "you can't do that", just dismiss it and move on. Don't dwell on it or overthink what this insecure voice says, just squash it immediately and replace it with an empowering thought."

You will see that if you do something silly or embarrassing, and someone thinks you're stupid, it doesn't really matter. Their opinion will only affect you as much as you let it.
