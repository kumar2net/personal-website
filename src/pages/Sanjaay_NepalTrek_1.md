# Nepal Journeys: An Annapurna Circuit Adventure

Our incredible journey through Nepal centered on the **Annapurna Circuit trail**, a challenging yet rewarding trek spanning approximately **120km from Phedi to Tatopani**. Don't let the distance fool you; the "undulating terrain" with its endless stairs makes every kilometer a significant effort\!

We flew into Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, then took a short domestic flight to Pokhara, the starting point of our hike.

## Memorable Moments

* **The Tatopani Hotspring:** A truly amazing and relaxing conclusion. "Tatopani" means hot water, and the mineral-rich springs worked wonders after days of trekking.  
* **Annapurna Base Camp (ABC):** The pinnacle of our hike at **4130m**. Be mindful of altitude mountain sickness (AMS) on the final approach. The sunrise from ABC is absolutely breathtaking.  
* **Bamboo Forests**: Throughout the walk, we entered several beautiful bamboo forests. The town with the bamboo forests was called Bamboo. We felt incredibly serene while trudging through the tall bamboo trees â€” a truly therapeutic experience\! In Bamboo, there is a shrine. Beyond this shrine, no meat is to be brought up, as it is deemed to offend the shrine. It is said that once, this rule was briefly relaxed and numerous natural tragedies unfolded. Since then, this rule has been reinstated.  
* **Ghandruk Village:** A beautifully preserved medieval village, offering a fascinating glimpse into traditional Nepali life with its unique stone houses.  
* **Poon Hill:** An iconic viewpoint requiring an early start (around 3 AM) to catch a stunning sunrise over the majestic **Dhaulagiri range** and other Himalayan peaks. Expect crowds\!  
* **Pashupatinath Temple**: Considered a sacred temple, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. No phones allowed inside. This is a Hindu temple, but the architecture is unique and looks like a Buddhist temple.
