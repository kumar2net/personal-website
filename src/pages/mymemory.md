new blog post with today system date and title:Memory evolution
i have 2 vivid images stored permanently in my Memory one is ofcourse my dad with teary eyes when i boarded the TNRTC expand this bus for my first job. And now when i read about how AI memories are being built it kind of brings in nostalgia. The years have quickly gone by for me the kind of advances i get to experience from early eighties to today. 
In AI, "memory" refers to the system's ability to store and recall information from past interactions, enabling it to learn, adapt its responses, and personalize user experiences. This can involve short-term memory for managing immediate context and long-term memory for retaining knowledge across sessions. Implemented through neural networks or external storage, AI memory is foundational for smarter, context-aware, and user-centric AI applicationsâ€”though challenges like privacy and efficient retrieval must be carefully addressed.
so this blog is about one such experience for me. We had an event and i just recorded 28 second video in my pixel 6 and this is the output in verbatim.

0:00 - 0:05
A young man and a woman are sitting on the floor with their eyes closed, holding hands. The man is wearing a green and yellow striped shirt, and the woman is wearing a dark green sari. Behind them, an older man in traditional white attire is also seated with his arms crossed. The room has a modern entertainment unit with a large black television screen.

0:05 - 0:10
The scene shifts slightly, showing the older man in white still seated with his arms crossed. The young man and woman remain in their seated positions, eyes closed. The entertainment unit with the television is visible in the background.

0:10 - 0:15
A different man, also in white attire, is now visible in the frame, sitting on the floor and looking towards the camera with a smile. He appears to be gesturing with his right hand. Several small metal cups are placed on the floor in front of him. The young man and woman are still seated with their eyes closed.

0:15 - 0:20
The man in white continues to speak and gesture, while the woman next to him, also in white, leans forward slightly. The young man and the first older man remain seated with their eyes closed. The arrangement of metal cups on the floor is still visible.

0:20 - 0:29
The focus returns to the older man in white, seated with his arms crossed. The young man and the woman are still in their seated meditation pose. The man in white who was speaking is now partially out of frame.
This is not english which was spoken in the clip, its Sanskrit!
