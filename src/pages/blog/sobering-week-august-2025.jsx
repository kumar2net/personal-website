              The Weight of Loss

              The news of Hanu's (that's how JK calls her) still rankling in my
              mind.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              She had to fly to India to be with the grieving family from
              Edinburgh where RJ has gone for a well deserved break. That they
              and AJ took a trip (West coast drive) is pretty good. The 3rd one
              went to Greece few weeks ago. All the 3 boys are grinding hard.

              All these geopolitical happenings, tariff, AI impact on world -
              there is a lot happening. All I would recommend is keep 6 month

              alternative.

              College Life Across the Ocean

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our boy youngest took me on video chat and showed me around his
              dorm in Uni. So nice to hear from him- excited tones, the frills
              of college life in the great country. The Prof's encourage
              students with seminars, group discussions, asking them put the
              phone and other distractions far away. The networking
              opportunities the Uni's provide there are unparalled. I am sure he
              will leverage this to the fullest.

              "Even keeping the device on the table will distract you. Read the
              book for 5 hours etc..".They are taking them on a field trip to DC
              in a few weeks. So different from the Rote learning we do in India

              Yesterday The Hindu editorial says 40 to 50% of Indian Engineering
              grads in the past decade are not placed in jobs! More and more
              youngsters are going to college but employers report difficulty in
              finding the right talent with skills. This really pains me.
