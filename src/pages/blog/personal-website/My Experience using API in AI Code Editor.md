          `Like many investors, I hold mutual fund schemes across various Asset Management Companies (AMCs). While each AMC provides its own portal, getting a consolidated, real-time view of my entire portfolio's performance was always a challenge. I envisioned a personal performance tracker that could pull data from all my schemes, offering a holistic perspective. This project became a fantastic opportunity to explore how modern AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) could simplify complex data challenges.`

          `The first major hurdle was data consistency. Mutual fund scheme names can be notoriously varied, and fetching their unique identifiers like ISINs (International Securities Identification Numbers) proved tricky. My primary source for official mutual fund data was the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) website. However, parsing data directly from AMFI, and ensuring that my internal scheme names mapped correctly to their official designations, was a labor-intensive task.`

            `<strong>Clean and Standardize Scheme Names:</strong> For schemes where direct ISIN fetching was challenging due to slight variations in naming conventions, GPT-4o was instrumental.
