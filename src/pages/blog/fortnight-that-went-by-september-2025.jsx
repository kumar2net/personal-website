                Learning About Jevons Paradox
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                I recently learned about the Jevons paradox and asked an LLM to teach me this concept. The explanation was fascinating, especially when applied to renewable energy and solar panels.
              </p>
              
              <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 mb-4">
                <p className="text-blue-800 font-medium mb-2">Prof. LLM's Teaching:</p>
                <p className="text-blue-700">
                  Let's look at how the Jevons paradox can apply to renewable energy 🔋, specifically with solar panels.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                When a homeowner installs a large solar array, they are generating their own electricity, making their power highly efficient and essentially free after the initial installation cost.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If the cost of running an appliance (like air conditioning or a high-powered electric heater) drops to near zero, how might that change the homeowner's consumption habits compared to when they were paying the high retail rate for grid power?
              </p>

              <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 mb-4">
                <p className="text-green-800 font-medium mb-2">My Response:</p>
                <p className="text-green-700">
                  He will run the appliance for more duration which say Aircon means he and family can get better sleep quality and hence feel a lot refreshed next day.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                That's exactly right! I identified the rebound effect at work. The homeowner's quality of life improves, but their total energy consumption skyrockets.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">How the Jevons Paradox Plays Out with Solar Energy:</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Efficiency/Cost Reduction:</strong> Solar panels make the marginal cost of running the A/C or heat pump effectively zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Rebound:</strong> The homeowner runs the A/C all day, sets the temperature lower, and buys more electric gadgets, leading to a much higher total demand for electricity than before.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic Impact (The Paradox):</strong> This surge in total electricity demand puts pressure on the entire energy system. Even though the source is renewable, the overall increase in demand means more materials are needed to build larger solar arrays and batteries to meet the new, higher demand level.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                In short, the efficiency of solar generation doesn't lead to energy conservation; it enables and encourages greater total energy use.

                AI in Education: "We Don't Need No (AI) Education"
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hahaha Double Negative usage. I listened to the podcast "We don't need no (AI) education" (The Economist Podcasts, Sep 20, 2025). Our youngest boy asked me to listen to this, and he somehow got me access despite the paywall!
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Key Points from the Podcast:</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>AI is transforming education:</strong> In US lecture halls and seminar rooms, students now use AI tools to write essays, solve complex problems, and even make everyday decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Educators face new challenges:</strong> Professors are struggling to detect academic dishonesty in new forms as students tap into AI's capabilities, often employing "invisible traps" to counteract cheating.</li>
                <li><strong>An education system in crisis:</strong> The episode explores how quickly AI is changing the landscape of learning—sometimes outpacing teachers in writing, reasoning, and teaching skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> The podcast asks what the future holds for education when AI can think, write, and teach better and faster than many human instructors.</li>
                <li><strong>Broader impact:</strong> This AI-driven shift is influencing not just how students learn and remember, but also how they make sense of the world.</li>
              </ul>

                <p className="text-yellow-800 font-medium mb-2">My Two Cents:</p>
                <p className="text-yellow-700">
                  If I am a student, I will leverage this to the hilt, use it effectively and score good grades. But at the same time, use the techniques and practices they use in USA universities effectively—group discussions, attending and speaking in seminars, actively interact with alumni. The professors can use all the techniques they want to catch cheating, but if they want to be relevant, they need to adopt the same techniques. All the old ways of exams and grades will be irrelevant if not already.

                Homelessness in San Francisco
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Our senior boy was so aghast seeing the amount of homeless people in San Francisco. He has seen this in Silicon Valley housing some of the biggest tech companies in the world.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This isn't new—I noticed it during my travels in the early 2000s, and it was a rude shock to me when I came to SFO from Sunnyvale, Milpitas. I had to catch the return flight and had to spend overnight in SFO, as I didn't want to risk that midnight 101 drive to reach the airport in time. The sight of homeless people sleeping on the streets, in the parks, under bridges was a rude shock to me. Even teen and middle-aged girls were roaming the streets at night.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                I am not sure what the solution to this is. But why isn't the CA state able to fix it? Is it due to severe shortage of affordable housing, loss of jobs, limited mental health and addiction services, and persistent failures in both local and federal policy to address these complex issues? Whether India or the great country, what the great poet said holds good.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 mb-4">
                <p className="text-red-800 font-medium mb-2">Bharathi's Famous Quote in Tamil:</p>
                <p className="text-red-700 text-lg mb-2">தனி ஒருவனுக்கு உணவு இல்லையெனில் ஜகத்தினை அழித்திடுவோம்</p>
                <p className="text-red-700">
                  This powerful line means: "If even one person is left without food, we will destroy the world"—emphasizing the poet's uncompromising commitment to social justice and universal compassion.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                When I see this, the tariffs, geopolitical tensions, AI—all these things seem so trivial. The real pain point is the amount of youngsters in this situation.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                It's Golu time and nice to observe what the women folks set out to shop for gifts—small Giri trading turmeric, kumkum sachets, thamboolam, homemade soap to Sundals. Of course, we eat a couple of varieties of these and fire all cylinders!
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Kotta pakku still exists! I used to like the way the betel nut tree—slim and grew so tall adjacent to coconut tree in our early days. Very elegant looking tree and the raw nut used to glow—orange nut with green cap. Touch nut to crack!
