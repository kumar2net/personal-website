              and economic absolutism — weaken civic well-being.

            to get central and state government scheme money for crop damage,
            women empowerment, and related welfare programs. This is really
            disgusting. Meanwhile, rich folks use middlemen who lurk in these
            offices and get stuff done easily.

              describe how corruption turns civic goods — welfare, fairness,

              fear that bribery erodes equality and moral trust. When access to
              justice or welfare can be bought, society loses its moral
              legitimacy and divides citizenship into two classes: those with

            <strong>Kumar. A:</strong> Yes, children shouldn't be paid to read
            or study well to get good grades. But parents can once in a while
            treat them to a dine out or go with them to their favourite sports
            event as a token of encouragement. This is totally acceptable
            according to me. But if there are two kids and one does well and the
            other doesn't, this discrimination and selective appeasement should
            be avoided. All five fingers are not the same.

              while allowing space for shared joy. “All five fingers are not the
