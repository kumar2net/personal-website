                    First was with our boy working for the mobile service provider for whom I played a part in Nokia 
                    providing managed services to them. So interesting to hear him out dabbling around a bit in ML. 
                    Vodafone India is now majority owned by Government of India at almost 50%. How things changed - 
                    when they were British owned the folks from UK - the parent company used to come and demand so 
                    much for so little! But they were a lot nicer than the current Indian major mobile duos. These 
                    were absolute penny pinchers wrt paying vendors for products/services.
