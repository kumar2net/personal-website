Introduction to the SQ3R Method

Highlight (yellow) \- Page 10

SQ3R is an active reading method developed by educational psychologist Francis P. Robinson in 1946\. The acronym SQ3R represents the five essential steps of this learning process: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review.

The larger the volume of material to be studied, the more we can benefit from techniques and strategies like SQ3R. Additionally, you can use it in conjunction with other methods, such as the Feynman Technique, smart notes, summaries, and mind maps, all of which can further facilitate your study process.

It is important to understand that active reading is crucial because it enhances comprehension and information retention. When we read passively, we tend to quickly forget what was read. However, by engaging with the text, the mind creates associations and connections, which facilitates memorization and practical application of the acquired knowledge.

Questioning and reflecting are fundamental for the formation of our knowledge\!

In Search of Knowledge Using SQ3R

Stage 1: The initial exploration of the text prepares your mind for detailed reading, helping to identify the structure and main points of the material. Stage 2: Formulating questions stimulates curiosity and directs your focus during reading, making the process more interactive and engaging. Stage 3: Active reading, guided by the formulated questions, improves comprehension and retention of the content. Stage 4: Reproducing the material, whether verbally, in writing, or using graphic elements, consolidates knowledge

and helps identify areas that need more attention. Stage 5: Periodic and systematic review reinforces long- term memory and ensures that knowledge is retained and easily recalled.

The final benefit I want to highlight about the SQ3R method is that it not only aids in theoretical understanding but also in the practical application of knowledge. By applying summarization and review steps, you can include activities like reflection and exercises where you translate information into your own words, making it easier to use the knowledge in real- life contexts.

The SQ3R method can be extremely useful when applied to the reading of textbooks, scientific articles, study materials for exams, technical reports, and other types of texts where the primary goal is informational or educational.

The journey with the SQ3R method is one of discovery, learning, and growth. By incorporating these strategies into your study and reading routine, you are investing in your own intellectual and professional development. Active reading is not just a skill, but a powerful tool that can open doors to new opportunities in your quest for knowledge.
