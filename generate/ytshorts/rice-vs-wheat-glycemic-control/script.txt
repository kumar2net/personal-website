Chapati is not automatically better than rice for sugar control.

In South India, many people switch to wheat and expect glucose to improve overnight.

But science says the full plate matters more than one grain.

In a North Indian mixed-meal study, rice and chapati meals had almost the same glycemic index when carbs were matched.

So swapping rice for chapati alone is not a magic fix.

Three levers matter more: choose less refined grains, control your portion, and pair carbs with protein and fiber, like dal, curd, and vegetables.

High intake of polished white rice is linked with higher diabetes risk, while whole grains generally support better glucose outcomes.

So ask this first: what type, how much, and with what?

Comment "PLATE" and I’ll share a South-Indian low-spike plate formula.
