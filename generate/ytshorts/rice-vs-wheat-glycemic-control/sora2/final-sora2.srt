1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,806
CHAPATI IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY BETTER THAN RICE

2
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:07,482
Many South Indians switch to wheat for sugar control

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:11,691
But the full plate matters more than one grain

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:19,173
Mixed-meal study: rice and chapati GI were very similar when carbs were matched

5
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:23,382
So grain swap alone is not a magic fix

6
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:28,058
1) Less refined grains
2) Portion control

7
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:33,670
3) Pair carbs with protein + fiber
(dal, curd, vegetables)

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,217
High polished white-rice intake links with higher diabetes risk

9
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:44,426
Whole grains generally show better glucose outcomes

10
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:47,231
Ask this first: type, amount, and pairing

11
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,240
