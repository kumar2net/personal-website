1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
CHAPATI IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY BETTER THAN RICE

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Many South Indians switch to wheat for sugar control

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,500
But the full plate matters more than one grain

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Mixed-meal study: rice and chapati GI were very similar when carbs were matched

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
So grain swap alone is not a magic fix

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
1) Less refined grains
2) Portion control

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
3) Pair carbs with protein + fiber
(dal, curd, vegetables)

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
High polished white-rice intake links with higher diabetes risk

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Whole grains generally show better glucose outcomes

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Ask this first: type, amount, and pairing

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,600
