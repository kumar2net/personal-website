Clear rule for better home Wi-Fi:
- Keep 5 GHz-capable devices on 5 GHz
- Keep legacy/IoT devices on 2.4 GHz
- Use band steering to automate this split

Why this matters:
2.4 GHz is usually more congested and has narrower channels, so throughput drops faster with contention.
Modern devices on 5 GHz reduce airtime pressure on 2.4 GHz and improve overall stability.

Ask your ISP for:
- Simultaneous dual-band router (2.4/5 GHz)
- Band steering support
- Wi-Fi 5 (ac) or Wi-Fi 6 (ax)
- WPA2/WPA3 + gigabit ports
