Primary request: Create a 12-second vertical hook that clearly separates 5 GHz-capable devices from legacy 2.4 GHz-only devices.
Scene/background: Apartment home layout with two wireless bands visualized as separate lanes.
Subject: Device grouping by Wi-Fi capability.
Action: Open with bold split-screen: left lane "5 GHz capable devices" (new phones, laptops, smart TV), right lane "legacy 2.4 GHz devices" (older phones, old laptops, basic IoT). Show congestion only on 2.4 lane.
Camera: Punch-in at 0-1.5s, then fast lane-by-lane pans with hard cuts every 2-3 seconds.

Color palette: cool blue for 5 GHz, amber/orange for 2.4 GHz, dark neutral background.
Style/format: Cinematic infographic, no logos, no real faces, 9:16 vertical 720x1280.
Timing/beats: 0-2s hook, 2-8s lane separation, 8-12s congestion contrast.
Audio: Original non-copyright electronic pulse, subtle warning tone on 2.4 congestion.
Text (verbatim): "Not all devices should stay on 2.4 GHz"; "5 GHz-capable -> move to 5 GHz"; "Legacy-only -> keep on 2.4 GHz"
