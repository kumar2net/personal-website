# esbuild Crash - Permanent Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed
The `npm run dev` command was crashing with esbuild goroutine deadlocks. This has been permanently resolved.

## Changes Made

### 1. vite.config.js
- Added comprehensive file watching exclusions to prevent esbuild from monitoring unnecessary directories
- Excluded heavy dependencies (pdfjs-dist, tesseract.js, docx-preview) from optimization
- Configured esbuild to use appropriate memory settings

### 2. package.json
- Updated `dev` and `dev:vite` scripts with `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'`
- Allocates 4GB of RAM to Node.js process to handle large projects

### 3. netlify.toml
- Updated dev command to include memory optimization flags
- Ensures Netlify Dev runs with sufficient resources

## How to Use

### Clean Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Clean up and reinstall (optional but recommended)
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Start dev server with new optimizations
npm run dev
```

### Normal Use
```bash
# Just run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## What This Prevents
- esbuild goroutine deadlocks
- Memory exhaustion errors
- 2-minute hangs followed by process aborts
- File watching resource overload

## Performance Benefits
- Faster dev server startup (fewer files to watch)
- More stable hot module replacement (HMR)
- Better memory utilization
- No more cryptic esbuild stack traces

## Troubleshooting

### If dev server still crashes:
1. Increase memory further in package.json: `--max-old-space-size=6144` (6GB)
2. Check for circular dependencies in new components
3. Ensure no infinite loops in React component renders
4. Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`

### If HMR stops working:
1. Restart the dev server
2. Check if files are in the watch exclusion list
3. Verify source files are in `src/` directory (not excluded)

### If build fails:
1. The optimizations only affect dev mode
2. Production builds use standard Vite config
3. Run `npm run build` to test production build
