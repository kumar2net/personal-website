# Cursor Rules

- Auto-update docs: Whenever code, features, endpoints, content, or configuration changes, update relevant files in `docs/` in the same PR.
  - Keep `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` appended with a 1â€“3 sentence summary per session.
  - Update topic-specific docs when touched (e.g., `BLOG_COMMENT_SYSTEM.md`, `SEO_SETUP.md`, `GA4_*` guides, `RECO_*` docs).
  - For new or renamed blog posts, ensure titles/tags are consistent and add any supporting notes under `docs/` if applicable.
  - Maintain clickable links and expand acronyms on first mention per house style.

- Writing style: Follow `docs/CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` and use shields-style badges for posts when relevant.

- QA before deploy: Confirm no console errors in Chrome DevTools on the dev server before merging to production.
